# Mythic Alliance Info

Whether it's to improve your karma or to satisfy the requirements for your third mark, you will need to complete some Mythic Alliances sooner or later.

You can complete 6 lesser alliances, followed by 3 greater alliances. The third mark of strength, Sam-san, requires all three greater alliances to be completed. Beyond that, you can take on a Sublime alliance - though these currently serve no purpose besides additional karma.

Mythic alliances involve meeting a Mythic leader, accepting his request, then slaying the required enemies and returning to the leader with the necessary items. Despite being 'alliances', this will not change the behaviour of the creatures in the cave.

Finding the leader in most mythic caves involves falling into the guardroom by stepping onto a randomly selected tile in particular rooms. Once you arrive at the guardroom, you can make your way through a door to visit the leader. Mythic Rat is slightly different, in that you can reach the leader without needing to fall. Mythic Tiger is especially tricky as you can fall into many other rooms besides the guardroom.

Once at the leader, say the name of that cave's enemy out loud to start a lesser alliance. The enemy pairings are rabbit - rooster, monkey - tiger, dog - dragon, rat - horse, snake - pig, ox - sheep. If you've finished all your lesser alliances and have reached the rank of il-san, you can instead say "Greater" to start a greater alliance.

In either case, the leader will direct you to slay bosses from enemy caves. For a lesser alliance, you'll need to kill three item bosses (avengers) and three key bosses (spirits) of the leader's directly opposing cave. You'll also need to return with four of that cave's unique item and eight of that cave's unique key.

For a greater alliance, you'll need to invade two other caves chosen randomly from the pool of caves you're not allied with, in addition to the cave of the leader's natural enemy. The leader will now require five item and five key bosses from each cave - thirty bosses in total! Thankfully, greater alliances do not require you to sacrifice any keys or items.

Mythic boss kills for alliances are tracked independently from other kills - you don't need to worry about killing other creatures. Watch your status box as you slay each boss to confirm that the counter has increased, as this counter will be the one the leader checks.

Once you've slain all your bosses (and amassed your items, for a lesser alliance) return to the leader and again speak either the enemy's name for a lesser alliance or "greater" for a greater alliance to complete your task.
