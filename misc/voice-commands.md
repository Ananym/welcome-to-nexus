# Voice Commands

The most common NPC functions - buying, selling, and bank management - can be accessed without using the menu by saying phrases out loud. The phrases are a little oddly formed.

## Buying and Selling

_These commands require item name to be exact and the whole command plus item name is case sensitive_

- Check what an NPC buys: "What do you buy?"
- Check what an NPC sells: "What do you sell?"
- Sell one item to an NPC: "Buy my X"
- Sell all of an item to an NPC: "Buy my all X"
- Sell specific quantity to an NPC: "Buy my X number 5"
- Buy specific item: "I buy X"
- Buy specific item in specific quantity: "I buy X number 5"

## Banking

_These commands are not case sensitive at all_

- Deposit an item: "I will deposit X"
- Deposit specific quantity: "I will deposit X number 5"
- Deposit all of an item: "I will deposit all X"
- Check how many of an item you have deposited: "How many X have I deposited?"
- Check how many total bank slots you are using: "What have I deposited?"
- Withdraw an item: "Give my X back"
- Withdraw several of an item: "Give my X number 5 back"

## Other

All NPCs will respond to "What's your name?" with their name. This appears to be a client-side feature, and works on absolutely everything considered an NPC, including birds, trees, mushrooms...
