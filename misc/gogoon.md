# Gogoon

Gogoon is a tropical island off the east coast. The tribespeople offer quests which reward pirate coins, and the island features a variety of hunting caves.

## Reaching Gogoon via Ferry

The original way to reach Gogoon is via the Ferry. Travel east of Kugnae to Dae Shore, then find the entrance to the ferry in the northwest corner.

The ferry departs every fifteen minutes - crew will appear and act out a scene in the leadup to the journey. The journey itself takes a few minutes.

While the ferry usually reaches the island, occasionally you will be shipwrecked! On the small shipwreck island you can chop the unique kapur wood to repair the boat and continue, or use a yellow scroll to get home and try again. Leaving via repairs will reward you a pirate coin. This shipwreck island is the only place to acquire Kapur wood, which is used for some Gogoon crafts.

## Watersocks Shortcut

A shortcut was later added to reach Gogoon in a hurry. Again travel to Dae shore, then to the southeast corner, where you can find a small boat to Kinung. On the east shore of Kinung (88,60) is a captain who will take you to Gogoon instantly if you can supply a green potion (southeast Kugnae alchemist shop) and 10k coins.

## Getting home

Casting Gateway on Gogoon will take you to one of the village's gates. Use a yellow scroll instead to get home. The building on the east side will sell yellow scrolls and offer banking.

## Quests

For the moment I'm only going to cover the one you came here for.

### Important Letter

Once in Gogoon, find and speak to Zuhair in the north side of the village, 66/106. Talk to him, agree to deliver his letter. (Saying No may involve a long cooldown period? I don't remember if this was addressed..)

You now need to visit every NPC in the village in reverse alphabetical order and say "Important letter" out loud near them. They will take about two minutes to read the letter - then say "Important letter" again to take back the letter and proceed to the next guard.

You can be a little lazier by shouting instead of just saying "Important letter", using the ! key, which will let you interact with guards off screen. You don't have to do this in one sitting, but there's no way to check where you got up to, so keep a note and don't lose your important letter!

I am going to shamefully copy and paste the list of guards from [NexusAtlas](https://www.nexusatlas.com/quests/gogoon-npc-largequests.php):

5. Vinikeneke (33,137)
6. Uleki (7,12 inside Jewels of JongSoo's at 27,147)
7. Timoteo (56,96)
8. Saulo (21,165 - Moves around a bit)
9. Rokeni (62,161 - Moves around a bit)
10. Quilber (26,154 - Moves around a bit)
11. Piankhu (45,155)
12. Oliwa (19,16 inside Aiata's tavern at 38,130)
13. Nanaeki (35, 159)
14. Mahal (2,8 inside Jalaharsa's Meat Hut at 52,130)
15. Leuga (63,161 - Moves around a bit)
16. Kalilinoe (22,147 - Moves around a bit)
17. Jawdat (82,171 - Moves around a bit)
18. Ianete (5,12 inside Naravas' Weapons at 60,144)
19. Hanauhou (6,15 inside Aiata's Tavern at 38,130)
20. Ghayth (81,99)
21. Fangatua (67,145 - Moves around a bit)
22. Eutakio (57,137 - Moves around a bit)
23. Duaita (65,172 - Moves around a bit)
24. Cani (38,100)
25. Bakile (6,10 inside Aiata's Tavern at 38,130)
26. Atiqu (49,155)

Each visit will net you one pirate coin, for a healthy 24 pirate coins once you sit through the whole thing. You should probably spend most if not all of this on [karma](character/karma.md).
