# Restore

Restore is a poet-only spell acquired through a quest. Restore is a powerful mana-scaled heal with aethers.

## Requirements

- Level 99
- Speaks Dog language (follow the start of the [NPC Subpath](character/npc-subpath.md]) guide)
- Trigram Keyset for yourself and helper

## Recommendations

- 25k+ vitality to avoid being instagibbed by Hellfires
- Atone, Remove Blind spells
- Non-BoD equipment (e.g. purple rings)

## Steps

You don't strictly need to visit the old man's dog before killing Storm, but it can help to confirm that you can speak dog before you start. Find them at 57/8 in the Wilderness.

You won't be doing this one alone. A player of sufficient size of any other path will be able to help (big poet helpers can still Axe storm, but may have to resort to self-resurrection to reach him).

Break the trigram keyset into the individual keys by using it.
Visit Tiger Palace with your helper (Travel to Arctic land on the world map, then cross the westward bridge and go north).
Interact with the doorman and click through **everything** he says without hitting 'close', or you will waste keys.
Start (h)anding him keys in sequence:  
Pond, Heaven, Fire, Wind, Thunder, Water, Earth, Mountain.
A spell effect will confirm each step.

Make sure you're grouped with your helper, then run/fight your way through the palace.

- Use the (m)ap to identify room exits - the palace is linear.
- Make sure to keep HB up at all times, as the Tigers do cast damaging spells at times.
- Consider using a mount item before entering each room to help you slip through.
- Otherwise, normal poet play - you will need to atone both yourself and your ally when cursed, remove blind when blinded, scourge targets that need to be killed to pass through.
- If you are poisoned, you can purge it using remove poison, or you can ignore it and communicate using group chat (whisper to !!) to bypass the poison's affect on speech.

 Reach the room "Rose Palace" (which is not the final room). Find Storm (he's a white, slightly pink-hued Tiger wearing brown clothing - confirm his name by rightclicking). Scourge him, let your helper take his attention (it helps not to run away from him!) and help your helper kill him.

 Storm has quite a long respawn time. If you reach Rose Palace and he genuinely isn't there, you may want to come back in a few hours. If you attempt this quest in the hours after a daily reset, he may not have spawned yet. After unlocking yourself for Tiger Palace, the unlocked state will last fifteen realtime hours.

 If you die in the process, you may still get the kill credit as long as you're nearby and grouped when Storm is killed, but I would be reluctant to count on this.

Immediately leave and visit the old man and his dog in the Wilderness (57/8). Talk to the dog to receive your restore.
