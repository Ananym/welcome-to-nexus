# Etched Weapons

The Etched Weapons are generally decent weapons that can be reliably acquired via repeatable quest, allowing players to equip themselves without needing to deal with a huge price tag. However, the quest itself involves a ten day real time wait and some tedious steps. Some trade-loving players will sell you a full set of the required items for a lump sum. The weapons themselves (acquired this way) cannot be traded.

Like almost all weapons worth using, these will Break on Death and require [kruna](economy/kruna.md) item protections to hunt with.

It is possible to partially complete the quest, then take your next -san mark, then complete the final step to receive a weapon for your new mark - this saves you having to spend the ten day wait with an old weapon. However, it's not advised to sit in this state forever, as some have reported their quest progress being cleared eventually.

## When do I need one?

- The level 99 warrior etched spear is not worth the effort, being ~1:1 with the cheap titanium blade.
- The level 99 rogue etched blade is 25% stronger than a cutlass skully, but lacks the curse-on-hit cast effect, and given that reaching il-san is usually pretty quick this may not be worth the effort.
- Il rogues interestingly can pick up the Light Broadsword as a carnage prize, for equivalent damage to the il etched blade (but carries an armor penalty)
- Ee+ rogues are usually well-served by making one of these.
- Il-Sam warriors can choose to use a Slog's club instead, which offers similar damage output but carries an armor penalty.
- For poets, these are always a nice-to-have but not that necessary in typical circumstances.
- For mages, these are valuable whenever you are using your mana-scaled damage spells, although cheaper options exist
- If you have access to NPC or PC subpath weapons, it's worth checking to see how they stack up against your prospective etched weapon.

## The Quest

(Guide also available at https://www.nexusatlas.com/quests/etchedweapons.php)

Travel to Kinung: Kugnae east gate, head east to Dae shore, go to the southeast corner, take the small boat to Kinung.
Find Taik'pae on the top floor(??) of his tent on the east shore of Kinung (83, 72).

- Talk to Taik'pae, promise him a Walsuk special
- Travel to Walsuk Tavern, say "Walsuk's special", then "Ingredients"
- Bring her:
  - 3 Peas - [Farming](economy/crafting?id=farming)
  - 1 Grilled Beef - [Preparing Beef](economy/crafting?id=food-preparation)
  - 1 Noodles - [Chefs](economy/crafting?id=cheffing)
  - 2 Salt blocks - Drop and pick up [cloth](economy/crafting?id=weaving) across Dae shore, over and over
- Say "Ingredients" again, wait 30 real minutes, say "Ingredients again"
- Take the special to Taik'pae to complete the first step

- Taik'pae will ask for:
  - 1 Lucky coin - Mythic rabbit bosses
  - 1 Pink Mugunghwa - Walk around Tangun (4, 217)
  - 1 Pebble - Walk around Trapper's Paradise (9, 5), found at Wilderness (53, 34)
  - 3 Fine Metal - [Smelting](economy/crafting?id=smelting)
- Bring him everything, then talk to him again about Distillation

- Talk to Panaeda in Tangun Potion Room (15, 115)
- Bring Panaeda:
  - 1 Star powder - Kugnae arena shop
  - 1 Moon powder - Kugnae arena shop
  - 1 Sun powder - Kugnae arena shop
  - 1 Purified water - Mythic tiger boss (requires falling into Revenge)
  - 3 Stardrop - e.g. Arctic Ogres
  - 1 Powdered yellow amber - [Alchemy](economy/crafting?id=alchemy)
- Talk to her again, wait 30 real minutes, and collect Frothy Distiller
- Return to Taik'pae, talk to him to give him the distiller, then return in ten real days!

- Taik'pae will ask you for 120 pieces of hot coal, see below.
- Then, bring to Taik'pae:
  - 1 Titanium Lance - 63 Mantis/Ogres
  - 2 Gold ore - [Mining](economy/crafting?id=mining), rarely
  - 2 Silver ore - [Mining](economy/crafting?id=mining), rarely
  - 1 Well crafted dark amber - [Gemcutting](economy/crafting?id=gemcutting)
- Finally, pay a chunk of coins (scales with mark) to Mananana downstairs for a diamond
- Return to Taik'pae to collect your weapon

## The Coal

Hot coal is made by combining Coal and Flash Dust in the Shift+I creation system for combining items. This must be done one at a time. You can only carry ten hot coal at once, and only three flash dust.

Tips:

- Several clans offer ways to buy and bank coal and flash dust. Bank all 120 coal and flash dust this way using [voice commands](misc/voice-commands.md) and text-macros.
- Hot coal itself cannot be banked.
- Some distance northwest of Taik'pae's tent is a market NPC who offers withdrawals.
- Find the spot closest to Taik'pae's tent where you can reach this NPC by shouting, e.g. 78,72
- Personally, I like withdrawing one coal/dust at a time. More keypresses, but by avoiding dealing with quantity, every iteration is identical and more mindless.
- Clear slot a and b in inventory
- Set text macros to "/s Give my Coal back" and "/s Give my Flash dust back"
- Hit both macros, make your hot coal (use tab to move button selection to 'ok' without needing the mouse)
- Either haul each full stack to Taik'pae as you go, or drop it where you are and haul at the end.
