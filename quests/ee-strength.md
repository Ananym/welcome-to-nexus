# Ee-san Trial of Strength

All of NTK's 'kill this' quests besides alliances work on a single kill tracker system. However, as Ee-san asks you to kill so many different creatures, the limits of the kill tracker complicate this task.

tl;dr: Turn in two pairs of bosses at a time to avoid ever risking the loss of kill credit.

## Kill Tracker logic

The kill tracker is a list of recent kills for your character. You cannot see it anywhere. Kill counts are grouped together by specific species of creature.

When you kill a species already on the list, the tracker just increments that count without moving entries.

When you kill a species not already on the list, the new species is added to the top of the list, bumping the other entries down.

When you go to turn in a quest, the entire kill list is scanned for the right species.

While you stay logged in, the kill tracker has no practical length limit. However, when you log out, or go through a server transition (e.g. entering ATG, entering a carnage) the kill tracker is truncated to only the top ten entries.

As such, you could complete Ee-strength in a single shot if you stayed logged in without changing server for every single kill (Tested!). Of course, this is not realistic for most. Bearing in mind the two boss species of each mythic cave plus the several smaller species, if you want to be sure you never lose credit for a boss kill during ee strength you should return to Bonhwa after every two pairs of bosses to turn them in.
