## What is NexusTK?

Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds is a 2D MMORPG set in mythical ancient Korea. It offers simple real-time combat and four base character paths: Warrior, Rogue, Mage, and Poet (healing/support).

Unlike many modern MMOs, NexusTK embraces a "living world" design. You are not The Hero. There is no Main Story. You're just another person participating in a story that has been underway for over 25 years. To this end, NTK has a strong community focus and encourages you to form connections with other players. Players hold political positions, lead and run the advanced subpaths, manage PvP events, and entertain one another through community games during downtime. If you've only played MMOs where other players are faceless strangers outside your guild or the LFG systems, NexusTK will be a very different experience.

NTK is also a rich environment for roleplaying, offering a variety of ways to solidify your character's identity and provide context for in-character interaction.

Perhaps surprisingly, NTK still has an eager PvP ("PK") community. Through a combination of design choices and odd gameplay quirks, PK in NexusTK is fast-paced, requires good team coordination, and manages to be quite compelling.

## Getting into the game

You can download the NexusTK Windows client at https://www.nexustk.com/ via the Download link in the sidebar. You may also need some of the secondary downloads to fulfil prerequisites. For troubleshooting, see [here](misc/technical.md).

You can create a trial character for free within the game client itself - no need to make an account via the webpage. Unregistered characters can only play until just before max level (a rather early point in the whole progression) and are limited in the items and gold they can hold. However, this is enough to get an idea of what the community is like.

When you're ready to move on, you can register at $10/month for four character slots. For more info, see [Registration](basic/registration.md).

The game does feature microtransactions, including cosmetics. While you can't buy power or direct boosts, some key convenience items also feature - although these are mostly unnecessary through the early game. For more info, see [Kruna](economy/kruna.md).

## History

In 1993, Jake Song began work on multi-user dungeon technology at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The recently founded Nexon took an interest, recruited Song, and released *Baram-ui Nara* (Baram) in 1996 as their first commercial product - placing it among the very first commercial graphical MMORPGs.

During development, Jake Song parted ways with Nexon and went on to develop Lineage, reusing the technological basis of Baram. He would later supervise Lineage II and work on ArcheAge (2013).

In 1997, a US version of Baram entered beta as Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds, reaching full release a year later. While built from the same foundations, the two products were never kept in sync and developed quite differently in terms of culture. Over time, the US branch placed greater emphasis on player governance and community-driven systems.

In 2005, the US branch of Nexon responsible for managing Nexus (along with Dark Ages and Shattered Galaxy) spun off as its own corporate entity: Kru Interactive. They retained a licence agreement for the NTK client and continued development separately. Sometimes.
