# Finding a Clan

It's widely recommended that you join one of the kingdoms' clans to find friends and support. The clans have different cultures and specialize in different things - but all are welcoming to new players, provided you are polite and friendly.

You can find clans on the [Clans & Ministries board](community/boards.md). You may also see them advertised in sages, or attend one of their community events. Approach any member of a clan to express your interest in joining.

Clans have different requirements for joining, but most are very accessible. You need to reside in the same kingdom as the clan you intend to join - it is possible to change your citizenship, however, which is a process that your new clan will generally be happy to help you with.

Try to learn a bit about the culture of a few clans before you pick one to join. Some may suit you more than others.

Once you're in a clan, try to get to know people. You can reach clan chat by whispering to '!'.

Once you're a little stronger, ask how you can help out - clans are more willing to support people who are interested in giving a little back.

Clan halls can offer a convenient place to restock on supplies or quickly travel to other destinations. The 'm'ap can help you navigate your clan hall - it may take you a little while to familiarize yourself with the entire layout.

By becoming a member of a clan, you represent that clan in public. Continue to act politely and respectfully to all if you wish to maintain good relationships with your new kin.
