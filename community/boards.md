# Bulletin Board System

NexusTK has a rudimentary in-game forum found by pressing 'b'. This will bring up a series of boards used for community announcements and discussion.

Not all boards will be available immediately - several only unlock at level 50(?).

Some boards, such as the law boards, aren't open for public post and are only there for public information.

Your character's personal mailbox is also found in this list.

## Significant boards

- **Dream Weaver**: Used for GM announcements of game changes
- **Community Board**: For in-game questions, comments, announcements
- **Clans and Ministries**: Used for clans and ministries to advertise themselves and their application process
- **Subpaths**: Used for subpaths to advertise both their application process and the public services they provide
- **Market (Buy/Sell)**: Used to post when you are buying or selling things!
- **Hunting**: Used to look for hunting partners - useful for e.g. alliance partners, arranged timeslots, unconventional caves, etc.
- **Community Events**: Used to advertise upcoming clan, subpath, ministry and carnage events.
- **Dreams**: For players to post suggestions for game improvement. Responses are rare.
- **Your clan board**: After joining a clan, you can access your clan-specific board here.
- **Scum**: Readonly board where people punished for breaking the law are (sometimes) named
- **Rambling Thoughts**: "Everything else", general discussion, somewhat more relaxed rules than Community

Some of these boards can also be accessed via http://boards.nexustk.com/ (no https version).
