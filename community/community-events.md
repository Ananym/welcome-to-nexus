# Community Events

You may notice Community Events being advertised via global messages or on the Community Events board. Attend them! Community events are among the best things NexusTK has to offer, when ran well. These events are typically held by clans, subpaths, or ministries, and can be extremely lucrative if you win. They cover a range of games from casual to serious, luck to skill.

You may not be equipped to participate in every event, as some depend on knowing certain spells. You can always ask the host if the event is appropriate for you via whisper. Even if you can't participate yourself, it's still entertaining to spectate and chat.

Unregistered players cannot enter the subpath public areas where subpath events are held, but a host can summon you in if you ask nicely.

It goes without saying that you should be respectful of the event, the players, and the host. Don't insert yourself into the game or play area inappropriately, don't pick up decorations or items used to mark the path to the venue.

Hosting your own events is a great way to contribute to your clan or subpath.
