# Legend Marks

*(Not to be confused with [Marks](character/marks.md).)

If you click on a player character and flip through their status window pages, you'll find their Legend. Players accumulate Legend Marks that serve to record their deeds in the Kingdoms.

These marks themselves are entirely cosmetic, although some of them represent accomplishments that have other rewards. Many players do, to some degree, enjoy collecting rare or interesting marks.

Legend marks are, generally, permanent.

Legend marks aren't neatly categorised in game, but there are the major sources -

## Quest marks

Many standard quests you will complete while developing your character will include a legend mark on completion.

## Event marks

Many marks originate from historic events, in which case, 'you had to be there'. There won't be any way to acquire these after the fact. Participate when (if) we get a new game-wide event to earn one of these.

## Subpath Quest marks

Many subpaths offer a number of community quests - some ran by guides, some implemented as NPC quests - which include legend marks as a reward. Not all of these may be available at any given time. You can explore the Subpaths section of the bulletin board to see what's on offer.

## Subpath Event marks

Some subpaths will apply their own marks if you turn up or win one of their community events. These are often incremental, counting up with repeat applications.

## Praise marks

Among the most highly regarded marks, these show that a subpath or ministry has internally decided that a player has demonstrated a value that said institution holds highly. There is no reliable way to acquire these.

## Red marks

When people say 'red marks' they are referring to jail marks and/or subpath derogatory marks, although other marks that happen to be red exist. Break the laws and you may earn a jail mark, which is a deeply unwelcome addition to your character and very hard to remove. Subpaths can also apply their own negative mark if they feel you truly deserve it, although these are very rare to acquire these days.
