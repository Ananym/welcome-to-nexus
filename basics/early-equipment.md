# Early Equipment

As a new adventurer, you'll need to update your equipment regularly to keep pace with your foes.

## Helms

Kingdom smith shops sell helms for males and helmets for females. These aren't level restricted - buy the best you can afford. Beyond an earth helm, look into a totem helm or clan helm once you're registered for a slight upgrade.

## Armor

Warriors and rogues pick up their armor from the smiths, while mages and poets pick up theirs from the tailors and seamstresses. Once you've outgrown these, you can look into the celestial armor quests.

Warriors also have access to powerful Tiger armor in the early levels. Speak to the kingdom tutors, Jadespear and Ironheart, to learn about the tiger. Then meet the tiger in his Buyan den near east gate, and greet him out loud by name - "Chongun". In exchange for materials, the tiger will forge stronger armor for you. Return as you gain levels to upgrade it.

## Hand items

Early on, you'll want rings from the kingdom jewellery shops. Purple rings are a good all-round option. Red rings enhance a warrior's damage and ability to hit targets, at the cost of some armor class. Black rings for rogues massively improve defence and ability to hit, and should definitely be picked up. Starting around level 50, more options are available as loot from strong foes.

## Weapons

Warriors and rogues can collect early weapons from the smiths. Around level 20, it helps to ask around to be loaned a Military Fork, as these are much stronger than any other accessible option until much higher in level.

Mages and Poets don't gain much from their weapons besides a little will and mana, and generally won't notice much difference from upgrades. Will does help the success rate of some mage spells. You can pick up a Wicked Staff at 50, and a Tuna Wizard Wand at 70.

## Shields

Shields offer defensive bonuses, though these are minor early on. You'll need to be registered to pursue a shield. You'll need to gain favor with the Nagnang guild for your path by completing a path-specific quest (warriors pick up their first shield this way), then embark on the Nagnag armory quest. People typically wait until level 97 to take this on, as this grants a stronger shield. Only rogues and expert mages are likely to be able to handle this quest alone!

## Subaccessories

Subaccessories are generally optional bonuses, but can make life slightly easier.

Starting level 40, you can enter the Tangun spearman cave. By gathering materials here, you can complete a nearby quest to earn a Floret Pendant. You can only make one pendant.

Starting level 60, you can work with the Sanhae smith to create special rings. This will involve gathering a Hunang's axe by slaying a trapdoor spider from Kugnae's spider cave, and a Battle helm found from mythic monkey bosses. He'll also ask for some expensive exorcist rings as bases. The resulting Gruff ring is powerful but fragile, and will break if you die. Take care! You can make more of these by repeating the quest.
