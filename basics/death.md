# Death

*Stood too close to the Rabbit, eh?*

Falling in battle may not be unrecoverable, but can still be an ordeal.

First thing's first - if you have a 99+ poet nearby, they can revive you on the spot. Otherwise, you can press Shift-F1 to open a menu that will let you follow your Silver Thread back to one of the kingdom Shamen to restore your body. Remember to say "Thank you"!

## Gear

Dying will damage all the gear that you are wearing, incurring repair costs. Some gear - generally, the good gear - is 'BoD' or "Break On Death", and is gone forever if you die while wearing it or even carrying it in your inventory.

In practice, nobody exposes their expensive items to this risk - instead players use [Kruna](economy/kruna.md) Item Protections, which for ~$1 USD will be sacrificed instead of your item if you've applied one. You can stack these up on an item, and check the remaining count by rightclicking.

*This system can sound unfriendly, but in practice avoiding death is not hard with a little practice and a lot of red potions.*

As for the damaged but surviving gear, most items can be repaired for gold at a kingdom smith. However, some items are prohibitively expensive to repair, and you may wish to use a friendly Sam-san Warrior's repair spell or an Item Restore kruna consumable to dodge this fee.

## Experience

The other major consequence of death is experience loss. Before level 99, this experience loss is small and will not seriously set you back. However, [after level 99](character/beyond-99th.md), you will lose half of all experience you are currently carrying. This can be quite a blow at the end of an otherwise productive hunting session. Make sure you trade in your experience for stats regularly after 99.
