# Getting Around

Experienced adventurers can traverse the kingdoms in the blink of an eye. Here are some tips on navigating the world.

## Navigation

* **Map system**
  Press 'm' to open the map, which shows your current area, NPC locations, and doorways to other areas. Some doorways that use non-standard logic won't show up on the map.

* **World map access**  
  Reach the world map through the kingdom gatherings past the North gate of each kingdom. Kugnae's gathering is in a small building off to the side of the road straight north.

* **Coordinates**
  The corner of the client shows your x/y position on your current map. This can be used to describe specific locations.

## Travel Methods

* **Gateway**
  The Gateway spell from the tutorial takes you to gates corresponding to your current location. Gating within a kingdom takes you to that kingdom's gates. Gating from Tangun, Wilderness, or Vale takes you to Mythic Nexus.

* **Innkeepers**
  Talk to innkeepers or clan greeters for transport (20 coin fee). Say 'Kugnae', 'Buya', 'Nagnang', 'Tangun', or 'Clan' out loud or via menu. Quick Mythic Nexus shortcut: visit Tangun and immediately cast Gateway.

* **Yellow Scrolls**
  Innkeepers sell Yellow scrolls that instantly send you 'home' (typically inns, or your subpath circle if you've joined a community subpath). Max 200.

* **Kindred Talismans**
  Registered characters can buy Kindred Talismans from their clan to return to clan hall from anywhere. Max 200.

## Mounts

* **Horses**
  Anyone can ride horses roaming the kingdoms. A reliable source is the northwest corner of Kugnae. Face the horse and press 'r'.

* **Permanent mounts**
  [Registered](basics/registration.md) characters can hold permanent mount-summoning items from the [Kruna store](economy/kruna.md). Some are tradable and highly valued, but work exactly the same. Clans or friends may give or lend you a basic mount.
