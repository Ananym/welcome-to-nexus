# Getting Around

Experienced adventurers can traverse the kingdoms in the blink of an eye. Here are some tips on navigating the world.

You can open the map by pressing 'm', which will show you the entire area you're in, NPC locations, and any portals to other areas. Some doorways that use non-standard logic won't show up on the map.

The Gateway spell granted by completing the brief tutorial will take you to any of the gates corresponding to your current location. Gating anywhere within a kingdom will take you to that kingdom's gates. Gating from Tangun, the Wilderness, or the Vale will take you to Mythic Nexus.

You can reach the world map through the kingdom gatherings, located beyond their respective north gates - or through the northern point of Mythic Nexus.

You can also talk to innkeepers or clan greeters for transport, for a tiny fee of 20 coins. Just say 'Kugnae', 'Buya', 'Nagnang' or 'Tangun' out loud or via the menu. As a quick shortcut to Mythic Nexus, visit Tangun this way and immediately cast Gateway. If you're in a clan, you can also say 'Clan' to an innkeeper to be brought to your hall.

Innkeepers sell Yellow scrolls which will instantly send you 'home' - which is typically the inns, but may be your subpath circle if you've joined a community subpath. Registered characters can also buy Kindred Talismans from their clan, which will similarly bring you to your clan hall from anywhere when used.

Anyone can ride the horses that roam the kingdoms. A reliable source is the northwest corner of Kugnae. Face the horse and press 'r'. Registered characters can hold permanent mount-summoning items from the Kruna store. Some of these mounts are tradable and valued highly - but the difference is cosmetic, all mounts function very similarly. Your clan or a friend may be willing to lend you a simple mount.

It's worth familiarising yourself with the warps your clan hall offers. You can use the map on 'm' to investigate any portals that might not be obvious at first glance.
