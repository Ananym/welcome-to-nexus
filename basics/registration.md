# Registration

As you may have noticed by now, you do not need a NexusTK account to make a character. However, for the full experience, you will need to pay for registration.

## Unregistered limitations

- Limited to a max level of 98
- Cannot hold many items beyond the necessities (can't hold some of those, either)
- Limited in how much gold you can carry
- Cannot enter subpath areas without help
- Cannot access the <99 experience booster (Little Wony's Modulator)

## How to Register

- Visit nexustk.com and follow the link to Account
- Coupon shop -> NexusTK -> Buy either the one month option ($10) or autorenewal ($10/month)
*The main benefit of autorenewal is additional [Daily Coin](economy/daily-coins.md) income*
- Receive the coupon code in your email (check spam!)
- Account Manager -> Create a new account
- Enter your coupon code
- Once your account is created, Add Game ID to associate your characters with the account
- It may take 10-15 minutes after adding your character for the status to update - then, log in to the game again

## Notes

- Each account has a rigid limit of four character slots
- Only one character on each account can be in-game at a time
- Your [Kruna](economy/kruna.md) balance is associated with your account
- Accounts need to be three months old in order to gift kruna items
- Adding a character to an account is irreversible
- Do not lose access to the email attached to your account!
