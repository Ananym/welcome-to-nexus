# Behaving Yourself

There are several laws you must be mindful of, including:

- Do not bypass the profanity filter,
- Do not steal others' items,
- Do not harass others,
- Do not make references to drugs or mature content,
- Do not use automation tools.

A more exhaustive list is available on the Law board.
Breaching any of these can result in harsh penalties.

NexusTK is a social environment - you will need to rely on others to succeed, and your reputation is important.
Don't spam chat if you need something.
Don't immediately beg for coins or items - the community is generous, but you're more likely to find help if you demonstrate that you're willing to learn and gather for yourself.

Try to prioritize finding others your size to play with - they'll need your help too.

If you attend community events, don't start picking up the playing pieces or decoration. These items generally aren't worth anything significant. Don't start deliberately talking over the host or players as they try to play. Instead, try joining in - community events can be fun and lucrative.
