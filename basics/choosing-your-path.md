# Choosing Your Path

At level 5, you will be required to choose a path to continue.

## Warrior

A straightforward option, warriors have very limited utility skills and focus on dealing damage to enemies using a combination of basic swings and vitality-draining special attacks. Good warrior play emphasises positioning, crowd management, familiarity with consumables, and a good intuition for co-operating with your group members. While warriors can solo smoothly early on, this rapidly drops off once curses are effectively required to deal damage.

In the arena a warrior's main virtue is their incredible armor class making them tough targets to crack, while they use their basic heal spell to support allies through healouts. A big warrior's strongest attacks can be used to good effect in the arena when well-coordinated with teammembers, and even the simple act of safely body-blocking a vulnerable opponent team member can be valuable.

## Rogue

A mobile fighter more focused on single target damage. Between their traps, mobility and utility spells, rogues can act independently in addition to serving valuable support roles within a group, although for most of the standard progression they don't achieve quite the same damage output as warriors.

Rogues excel in the arena, where their stealth, traps, mobility and single target damage shine.

## Mage

A caster path emphasizing monster management and high damage single-shot spells. Mages can offer supplementary damage to a group while improving group safety with effective crowd control. Capable of soloing slowly but effectively, especially in areas where their spells kill monsters in one hit.

Mages are powerful but vulnerable players in the arena, since their attacks can hit targets reliably at any distance. However, their weaker armor and limited defense mechanisms require a more cautious playstyle.

## Poet

A pure support path, poets balance time between debuffing targets and healing allies. Poets play reactively to the needs of their group, and generally cannot accomplish anything alone. However, as they co-operate well with any other path, it is usually straightforward for a poet to find hunting companions. A poet's capacity for healing does impact the speed of the hunt, until the other group members are limited more by their spell cooldowns rather than their health and mana. Despite their poor AC, poets can use harden body to remain invulnerable to damage most of the time.

In the arena poets take on an extremely important role in removing protective spells from opponent targets, which is a necessary step for landing kills on any hard targets. Poets will need to coordinate with damage dealers to ensure an enemy is dispelled, cursed, and killed before an enemy can interrupt. At the same time, poets will need to be removing curses and restoring protective spells to allies. Even a tiny poet played well can have a big impact on the outcome.
