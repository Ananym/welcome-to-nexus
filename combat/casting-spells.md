# Casting Spells

## Basics:

Use the spell tab of your interface or press + to see your spell list. You can cast any of these spells with Shift+Z.

Using the F11 interface (or 'hotkeys' through the menu button) you can assign your spells to number keys. You can use the next page button to instead assign them to Ctrl+number or Alt+number.

You can assign items to these slots by clicking on the item tab with the F11 interface open. This is particularly useful for spellcasting items like Orbs.

You can also assign snippets of text to speak by pressing ; on the slots. Prefixing your message with /s will allow you to shout the snippet.

## Targeting:

There are several ways to target in NexusTK.

By default, cast your spell, use the arrow keys to cycle the reticule to your target, then press enter. Press Esc to cancel the cast. Press Home while targeting to snap the reticule back to yourself.

To target by mouse, it's recommended to turn on "Simple Click" in the options tab. Cast your spell then click on your target. It's possible to cast the same spell in succession by holding the spell button and clicking multiple times on multiple targets. You can walk by holding right click - it may help to disable "Right click look" with Shift+R to avoid inspecting creatures and items instead of walking.

There are some helper functions to make targeting more convenient.

**Sticky Targeting** is on 'v' by default, but can be swapped to tab with Shift-F11.

To use sticky targeting, press the key, move the reticule to your target, and press the key again. All spells you cast will automatically use this target until you cancel with esc. Once cancelled, you can double tap the key again to instantly return to the same target. This is useful for protecting a specific person at a moment's notice.

**Cycle Targeting** is on tab by default, but can be swapped to 'v' with Shift-F11.

Press the key and your target will snap to an enemy.

If you hold ctrl while pressing, your target will snap to an ally instead.

All spells cast will automatically use this target until you cancel with esc. You can continue pressing the key to cycle between all available targets of that type automatically.

Target settings can be found via the Menu button. These let you change the way targets are selected during default targeting with arrow keys. You can adjust Shift+arrow to target only other player characters, for instance.
