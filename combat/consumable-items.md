# Consumable Items

This page covers the standard consumables everyone should be familiar with.

## Using consumables

While items can be (u)sed with the u key, the fastest way to use consumables is to hold Ctrl + (Inventory item letter).
Items can also be assigned to number keys using the hotkey/macro interface on F11, by opening the interface and then your inventory.

## Vitality

Bear livers can be purchased from your path's guild hall, and serve as an effective healing item through the early levels.

Eventually you may want to shift to Life Blossoms, sold in the Bodhi Sanctum on Dae Shore, east of Kugnae. Only registered characters can enter this subpath area - unregistered players may need to ask other players to buy blossoms for them. While Life blossoms don't represent the same per-slot healing as a stack of livers, you can carry as many blossoms as you have inventory slots, allowing you to stay in caves much longer.

It's a good idea for everyone, but especially warriors, to carry emergency healing items for a pinch. Mountain ginseng fills this role early on, healing 10k vitality per use, and is sold by clan merchants. Eventually 10k vitality is no longer enough to get you out of danger, and you will want to swap to Red Potions for a 100% heal sold by Kugnae's alchemist shop in the southeast corner. Red potions are expensive, but much cheaper than recovering from a death! Always make sure you keep your emergency healing in a known and remembered inventory slot, so you don't need to spend time searching your inventory while battered by monsters.

## Mana

Herb pipes are the primary mana restorative, sold by your path's guild hall. Other pipes are available, but nothing provides more mana per slot than the basic herb pipes.

Poets and mages will learn "invoke" naturally to supply their mana needs. Rogues will learn "Chance" at ee-san which allows them to invoke. Besides that, warriors and pre-ee rogues are dependent on a poet's "inspire" once they outgrow pipes. However, in the cases where a poet is not available, Scrolls of Invocation can be used to allow anyone to invoke. These are crafted by players practicing [Scribing](economy/crafting.md?id=scribing). You can only carry six at once. However, they are still recommended if you need to hit your highest level of rage or cunning while by yourself.

## Status

Scrolls of Protection are similarly crafted by scribes, and will preemptively block curses from creatures such as mythic leaders. They will not cure curses once applied - only a poet can do that. An il-san warrior learns Hoche to provide the same effect, although this cannot provide 100% uptime. While these can be useful in carnages when used precisely, an enemy's dispel will strip your protection. The right time to use an SoP in the arena is immediately after being hit with a dispel, delaying the enemy attack for just a moment to give your team time to focus support on you.

Mythic leaders can also poison you. Although it confuses your speech, this isn't a very threatening effect, and can be cured with an Indigo potion sold by alchemist shops. Notably talking in group chat (whispering to '!!') isn't affected, if you need a way to talk through poison.

Green potions can also be found at the alchemist shop, and offer a few minutes of Sanctuary, halving all incoming damage. Likely too expensive for regular use, they can still be handy in a pinch.
