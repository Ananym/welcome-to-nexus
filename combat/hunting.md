# Hunting

This is intended to be a bare minimum guide to each path in group play.

## Warrior

- Always cast Backstab and Flank, and try to position yourself to hit multiple enemies.
- Consider using taunt to get a monster's attention to ensure you hit as many targets as possible.
- Only cast the strongest fury you have among Wolf's Fury, Tiger's Fury, Dragon's fury, Chung Ryong's rage, or your subpath rage.
- Enchant/Infuse/Ingress and beyond directly multiply your weapon damage - only cast the strongest one you have. These have no duration, but you'll need to recast them if you change weapon or move through a loading screen (including entering ATG).
- Bless and Potence are useful during the early levels, but you won't notice much difference after your 99th.
- Make sure you familiarise yourself with the different [consumables](combat/consumable-items.md) available.
- Slash is realistically only a melee taunt, but still has its uses.
- Berserk and Whirlwind will be underwhelming at first, but ramp up quickly as you gain vitality after 99. Make sure to align yourself with Ming-ken or Ohaeng, as unaligned or Kwi-sin whirlwind is extremely risky!
- You will most likely want to skip learning the warrior self-heals, as consumable healing items are readily available and heal for much more.
- The level 99 rages work differently from the furies. Rages can be recast after their cooldown to enhance the effects of the spell, granting a higher damage multiplier and a bigger armor class penalty. Each tier will require a higher mana cost to cast than the last. Chung Ryong's Rage 6 has a huge +50 AC penalty! Rage also amplifies the amount of durability lost on your weapons when swinging, making low-durability weapons harder to use at high ranks.

Warrior Rage Tier minimum mana costs:

| Tier | Rage    | Stance   |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 1    | 2,000   | ~3,000   |
| 2    | 7,200   | ~10,000  |
| 3    | 18,050  | ~21,000  |
| 4    | 33,800  | ~37,000  |
| 5    | 72,200  | ~76,000  |
| 6    | 145,800 | ~152,000 |

## Poet

- Poets have very little offense beyond the lowest levels - you'll soon need to find others to group with.
- Maintain Harden Armor and Sanctuary on all group members. Harden Armor improves AC, while Sanctuary directly halves all incoming damage. Valor is only a noticeable difference at the very lowest levels.
- You can safely skip learning the self-heals or multiple target heals - these generally aren't very useful.
- There are a variety of utility spells as a poet that can be skipped if you want to streamline the levelling process.
- Use Invoke to maintain your own mana, use healing spells to keep your group alive. Later, you'll be expected to use Inspire to restore others' mana.
- Once you learn Scourge, you can drastically increase the damage taken by enemies. Try to make sure every target your group intends to kill is scourged.
- Once you learn Harden Body, you can make yourself invulnerable to all incoming damage for twelve seconds. Harden body can be dispelled in carnage events, has a fixed success rate of 50%, and is much easier to maintain after 99 when the mana cost is no longer significant.
- As a poet, it's important to understand the different ways to [target your spells](combat/casting-spells.md) in order to play efficiently and respond quickly.
- Shortly after reaching level 99, you should be aware of the [Restore quest](quests/restore.md). Restore is a mana-scaled heal that represents a significant part of a poet's kit. The quest is not too difficult, although you will need the help of a larger player. I recommend not bringing any items that will break on death, making sure you know remove blind and atone, and waiting until at least 20k vitality to avoid getting oneshot.

## Rogue

- In the earliest levels, Singe and Ignite may deal more damage than your swings.
- Only cast the strongest fury you have.
- Recast invisible between swings for substantial bonus damage.
- Once you learn ambush, you can alternate between Invisible and Ambush for rapid attacks. Alternatively, if the monster isn't actively attacking you, it may be more effective to focus invisible swings on its rear for the double damage.
- Desperate Attack will do very little damage while levelling, and is costly to cast.
- Lethal Strike, on the other hand, is very efficient to cast and will scale quickly.
- Blind trap will prevent a monster from moving - useful if you have a weapon with range.
- Snare trap will cause a monster to take more damage, useful if you have no casters with you to offer stronger curses. Amnesia causes monsters to ignore you, useful while alone to take on targets one at a time.
- Rogue heal spells are stronger than those of warriors, and some can target allies - though you may not necessarily need to learn these in a hurry, as [healing items](combat/consumable-items.md) are still much stronger.
- At 99, you may wish to invest in a Polearm if you find yourself grouping with Mages. Weapons with range don't break invisibility, provided that you don't hit a target directly next to you. As the range also allows you to hit multiple targets, this can produce impressive damage output.
- A rogue's level 99 cunning uses similar recast/tier mechanics as a warrior's rage, although it does not penalise your armor nor inflict additional durability damage.

Rogue Cunning Tier minimum mana costs:

| Tier | Cunning | Skill-up |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 1    | 3,000   | 4,711    |
| 2    | 4,200   | 4,711    |
| 3    | 15,634  | 17,960   |
| 4    | 46,658  | 53,646   |
| 5    | 117,667 | 135,327  |

## Mage

- Mage's offense is reasonable while levelling, especially if you make use of the 4-way surrounding zap attacks.
- Maintain Harden Armor and Sanctuary on yourself and your group members. Use Vex to cause enemies to take extra damage, unless a poet with Scourge is present.
- Static and Paralyze can be used to stop enemies moving or attacking, useful for reducing incoming damage if it's too high to deal with. Blind, meanwhile, only prevents enemies from moving - but lasts much longer.
- Remove paralysis is a surprisingly important spell, as later on you may want to carefully adjust monster position into advantageous patterns for your group.
- Use wine or pipes to maintain your mana until you learn invoke. However, mage heals are not especially potent - you may still wish to carry your own healing items.
- Hellfire is a powerful attack that scales as you train your mana after 99. You will want to use Sleep or Doze beforehand to multiply its damage. Using hellfire and invoke will cost a lot of health - don't feel obliged to keep yourself fully healed at all times. By keeping your distance from monsters and using your control spells, you can get away with only healing yourself enough to take a couple of hits.
- Do not cast Hellfire at extremely low vitality - the recoil CAN kill you!
- At the time of writing, a handful of [mage orbs](combat/orbs.md) are available to 99+ mages from the Buyan incubator, free of charge. Orbs are items that cast spells on use without being consumed. These include scourge, a second invoke with half aethers, and a second attack spell which is more efficient to cast. You should always pick these up as they represent a powerful set of bonuses.
- As a mage, it's important to understand the different ways of targeting your spells. Spell hotkey setup for mages is quite individual. Casting via mouse is worth learning for mage, as controlling monster positioning is easier if you don't have to spend time moving the reticule.
