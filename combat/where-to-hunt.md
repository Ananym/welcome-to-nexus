# Where to Hunt

For the most part, you should allow the requirements of your spells to govern where you hunt as you progress through the early levels.

At times you may want to visit Mythic Nexus through the world map, which offers a variety of hunting caves at different levels.

However, for the most part, when focusing on pure experience the correct cave is one of the Ancient Training Grounds. The most popular of these is west off Kugnae's west gate. This is a tiered cave and covers many levels. You can enter tier 1 at level 11, but you are unlikely to be able to fight effectively there until level 35ish.

ATG has some mechanics allowing you to hunt with allies of different strengths. You're able to enter your highest tier plus the two tiers underneath. Entering a lower tier will penalize your stats and experience gain. However, it can often be more effective to hunt in a lower-than-highest tier due to the lesser durability of the monsters.

(The game is in fact completely broken by this system, which encourages staying in ATG5 as long as physically possible using microtransactions to store experience, and even taking a higher mark and reducing your stats to remain in the desired tier. This sucks for everyone involved.)

The minimum stats to enter each ATG tier are as follows:

| Tier | Requirements                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Level 11                                |
| 2    | Level 50                                |
| 3    | Level 99                                |
| 4    | 40k/20k vitality/mana                   |
| 5    | 80k/40k vitality/mana                   |
| 6    | 160k/80k vitality/mana (Il-san stats)   |
| 7    | 320k/160k vitality/mana (Ee-san stats)  |
| 8    | 640k/320k vitality/mana (Sam-san stats) |
| 9    | 2m/1m vitality/mana                     |
| 10   | Too big to recall                       |

_Note: Sa-san stats doesn't get a dedicated tier_
