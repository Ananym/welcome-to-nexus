# Where to Hunt

For the most part, you should allow the requirements of your spells to govern where you hunt as you progress through the early levels.
Many of the normal kingdom caves have equivalents in Tangun, and Tangun also has a few unique caves of its own. You can reach Tangun by talking to the innkeepers. Monsters in tangun are generally slow to kill but reasonably rewarding, and some items are easier to find here.

At times you may want to visit Mythic Nexus through the world map, which offers a variety of hunting caves at different levels. The normal monsters here drop only ambers (and less so than the aklak training grounds) but the bosses drop a variety of useful items. Mythic Nexus starts with Mythic Rabbit in the northeast, accessible from level 25.

However, for the most part, when focusing on pure experience the correct cave is one of the Ancient Training Grounds. The most popular of these is west off Kugnae's west gate. This is a tiered cave and covers many levels. You can enter tier 1 at level 11, but you are unlikely to be able to fight effectively there until level 35ish.

ATG has some mechanics allowing you to hunt with allies of different strengths. You're able to enter your highest tier plus the two tiers underneath. Entering a lower tier will penalize your stats and experience gain. However, it can often be more effective to hunt in a lower-than-highest tier due to the lower monster armor and vitality.

(The way this system has been implemented has been deeply unhealthy for the game, as it encourages staying in ATG5 as long as physically possible using microtransactions to store experience - and even taking a higher mark and reducing your stats to remain in the desired tier. This sucks for everyone involved except for Kru, who benefit from all the extra envelope sales.)

The minimum stats to enter each ATG tier are as follows:

| Tier | Requirements                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Level 11                                |
| 2    | Level 50                                |
| 3    | Level 99                                |
| 4    | 40k/20k vitality/mana                   |
| 5    | 80k/40k vitality/mana                   |
| 6    | 160k/80k vitality/mana (Il-san stats)   |
| 7    | 320k/160k vitality/mana (Ee-san stats)  |
| 8    | 640k/320k vitality/mana (Sam-san stats) |
| 9    | 2m/1m vitality/mana                     |
| 10   | Too big to recall                       |

_Note: Sa-san stats doesn't get a dedicated tier_
