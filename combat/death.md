# Death

_Stood too close to the Rabbit, eh?_

Death is not the end, but can still be a bit of a headache.

First thing's first - if you have a 99+ poet nearby, they can revive you on the spot. Otherwise, you can press Shift-F1 to open a menu that will let you follow your Silver Thread back to one of the kingdom Shamans to restore your body. Remember to say "Thank you"!

## Gear

Dying will damage all the gear that you are wearing, incurring repair costs. Some gear - including lots of prized items - is 'BoD' or "Break On Death", and will be destroyed forever if you die while wearing it or even while carrying it in your inventory. Make sure you know which of your items will break on death! This is not information available in the game interface - you may want to check with other players or websites.

In practice, nobody exposes their expensive items to this risk - instead players use [Kruna](economy/kruna.md) Item Protections, which for ~$1 USD will be sacrificed instead of your item if you've applied one. You can stack these up on an item, and check the remaining count by rightclicking.

_This system can sound unfriendly, but in practice avoiding death is not hard with a little practice and a lot of red potions._

As for the damaged but surviving gear, most items can be repaired for gold at a kingdom smith. However, some items are prohibitively expensive to repair, and you may wish to use a friendly Sam-san Warrior's repair spell or an Item Restore kruna consumable to dodge this fee.

## Experience

The other major consequence of death is experience loss. Before level 99, this experience loss is small and will not seriously set you back. However, [after level 99](character/beyond-99th.md), you will lose half of all experience you are currently carrying. This can be quite a blow at the end of an otherwise productive hunting session. Make sure you trade in your experience for stats regularly after 99.

Similarly, if you are carrying any Kruna Experience Envelopes, half of these will be destroyed during death.
