# Orbs

If you're just starting out, this page won't matter to you yet! However, when you see people mention orbs, here's what's going on.

Orbs are temporary items that cast spells without being consumed, providing significant advantages in combat and utility. There are several different categories of orb, with different costs and uses. No orbs can be used in [Carnages](community/carnage-events.md).

## Using Orbs

Orbs cast spells when used as items, but can also be added to your number keys by opening your hotkey settings (F11), then clicking on your inventory tab and entering the letter for an orb into your desired hotkey slot.

## Damaged Orbs

These orbs are intended to allow players to achieve more while solo by giving each path access to spells from other paths. These cannot be used while in a group, and will reduce your experience income and item drop rate by half for each one you are carrying while ungrouped.

Acquired from the Incubator at Buya Gathering (north gate and head north). These cost 2 [Daily Coins](economy/daily-coins.md) and don't last very long.

Damaged orbs available to all include:

- Suppress (armor reducing curse)
- Invoke (trade vitality for mana)
- Restore (mana-scaling heal)
- Ballad of Min (single target large heal, 6k mana cost)
- Volcanic Blast (5-way zap)
- Whirlwind Ripple (a highly self-damaging vitality-scaled attack in two directions)
- Lethal Strike Ripple (a somewhat self-damaging mana-scaled attack in two directions)

Some paths get more use out of these than others.

## Mage Orbs

Mages specifically have access to a handful of completely free orbs that don't have the damaged drawbacks, effectively acting as additional spells. Mages should pick these up when they become useful, but they do need to be re-collected regularly.

These include:

- Invoke (an additional invoke, on a separate lower cooldown)
- Scourge (armor curse equivalent to poet scourge but slower to cast)
- Sul slash (a powerful single shot attack, similar to hellfire, scales differently)
- Ripple (inflicts a status that causes some overkill damage to spread to nearby enemies)

## Premium Orbs (Malgalod)

For advanced players, Malgalod offers powerful orbs that cost coins and Malgal Insignias (gathered from Malgal soldiers).

The cost for premium orbs scales with your rank. These are purchased from blue NPCs in Malgalod.

| Level Range | Insignias Required | Coin Cost |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Pre-99      | 5                  | 20,000    |
| 99-Ilsan    | 20                 | 100,000   |
| Eesan       | 35                 | 200,000   |
| Samsan      | 50                 | 300,000   |
| Sasan       | 75                 | 500,000   |

You should be aware of these premium orbs, but a few others exist.

- **Warrior**

  - Fast Whirlwind Ripple - front/back whirlwind attack, short cooldown (24h duration)
  - Slow Whirlwind Ripple - front/back whirlwind attack, long cooldown (72h duration)

- **Rogue**

  - Lethal Strike Ripple - front/back lethal strike attack (72h duration)

- **Mage**

  - Self-Restore - mana-based self-heal (7d duration)

- **Poet**
  - Restore - additional restore with reduced mana cost (7d duration)

Value for money varies by path:

- Mage: Self-restore orb is potent for solo play and still convenient in groups
- Poet: Extra restore orb is extremely strong at all stages, but not strictly required early in the progression given ATG's bias towards swing damage rather than vital attack damage.
- Rogue: Lethal strike ripple orb becomes mandatory for damage later in the progression
- Warrior: Whirlwind orbs are fun but considerably less impactful than your basic swings until the top end of the progression.
