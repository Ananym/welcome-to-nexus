# Carnage Events

The Carnage department hosts a number of competitive games for the community, both on a regular schedule and randomly throughout the day. You can find the schedule posted on the boards outside the various Kingdom arenas and Buyan stables.

## Riches

Team-based player vs player combat.

Some riches are uncapped and anyone may attend, while others are limited to those under a certain mark. You may be balanced down if your stats are above the strength of the event. If your team is victorious, you can pick a prize - the options depend on your strength. Prizes include weapons and hand items, a small amount of Karma, or at 99 and above, 1b experience via a Bringer's Gift. Riches are held in Kugnae's arena.

## Bloodlust

Similar to a Riches, but without material prizes. A common type of Bloodlust is called Crusades, where all participants are balanced down to 640k vitality or 320k mana. You must be at least level 51 to enter. Crusades specifically are held in Nagnang's arena, while other Bloodlusts are held in Buya's arena.

## Elixir War

A unique game played with bows and dye arrows. The objective is to obtain the enemy team's elixir from their base and bring it to the centre. This is done by stepping on the opponent's colored base tile, then reaching the centre and (h)anding an acorn to the central NPC - make sure you have one! If you are struck by an enemy arrow, you will be dyed in the enemy colours - if you take a step while dyed, you are out. However, an ally can shoot you to restore your dye to normal.

Winning an elixir war will earn you either dye potions or Elixir tokens, which can be exchanged for cosmetic bows. You must be registered and at least level 51 to enter elixir wars, and they are held in Nagnang's arena.

## Fox Hunt

A fast-paced game played on horseback. One member from each team volunteers as captain, summoning a fox that will follow behind them. The remaining players are trappers. The trappers aim to surround the enemy captain or fox and prevent them from moving, while the captains evade capture. The first team whose captain or fox remains still for a few seconds will lose the round.

Fox hunts offer item prizes, with a slightly different selection to Riches. You can also acquire Fox hunt tokens, which can be exchanged for cosmetic mounts. Fox hunts are held in the Buyan stables, just southwest of east gate.

While bloodlusts and elixirs don't offer prizes of monetary value, the legend marks earned from winning are vital for passing the trial of skill for your third mark.
