# Path Tips

This page will cover some absolute basics of playing in carnages.

You will also want to take a look at [Client / Server Behaviour](misc/client-server-behaviour.md).

## Everyone

When selecting equipment for carnages, you will want to prioritize AC while still making sure you have 7 protection (more than 7 does not help). Weapons like fox blades and fans can be useful for boosting your AC, although there's also an argument for weapons with huge stat boosts to empower your attacks.

Kills in PK are typically performed in one shot, or in one ~instant combination of attacks. To kill a "top", or someone at the top of the stat range for the carnage, you will likely need to be a top yourself, or close to it, depending on your target's armor. In addition, the target will need to be weakened - their sanctuary should be dispelled, and they should be cursed, and possibly slept. As such, kills on tops require good team coordination.

Dispel has a fixed 20% success rate, and curses have a fixed 30% success rate assuming the target has 7 protection, so coordinating an attack relies on reacting quickly to successful casts. This coordination can be calling names in group chat, or often these days, called out in discord voicechat.

"Tanking" is the term for killing a top through brute force despite these protections, and is regarded as bad form. However, brute-force kills on non-top enemies are considered fair game.

Even if you are not a top, try to be aware of the size and defenses of your available targets - you may still be in a position to take a kill here and there. Being able to judge your targets well can allow you to pick the sequence of attacks that will reliably kill the target without putting you at unnecessary risk.
However, all players can support their team in a number of ways besides simply scoring kills.

When you first get into the arena, use the Ctrl+w Heroes board sorted by level to understand which players in the match are strongest within their path, and therefore most important to protect / eliminate.

Understanding how to survive takes priority - you can do nothing while dead! Survival hinges on positioning, staying out of the way of threats unless you have a reason to be there. Make sure you're familiar with how to execute food-based healouts for yourself.

All paths have a targeted heal that can be used to healout members of your team currently in danger. Try to keep your [Sticky targeting](combat/casting-spells.md) on a valuable member of your team so you can help them quickly if they're under attack. This is among the most useful things small warriors and rogues can do.

If one of your allies has been slept, you should damage them slightly to wake them up. Poets with harden body active cannot be woken up until it ends. (Rogues, be wary of trying to hit small team members out of sleep, you may kill them if invisible!)

## Warriors

Warriors are not a terribly offensive path in PK, as Berserk and Whirlwind are only strong enough to kill people significantly weaker than you. Look out for these opportunities, but focus mainly on healouts on your team.

At the higher end of the stat range, if well-equipped, a warrior's superior AC makes them a hard target. You can leverage this by staying closer to the action and blocking enemy movement at key moments - just be careful not to get in your own top fighters' ways! You're still at risk of dying in doing this, but if the enemy spends an attack cycle trying to kill you, that's time not spent killing someone more impactful - even better if you manage to healout.

Slash is a valuable tool for waking allies from sleep, as unlike swings or zaps it is guaranteed to land.

## Rogues

Small rogues again should focus on staying alive and maintaining healouts on key players. Trying to leave your team entirely to pick off small enemies while invisible sounds attractive but you will likely do more good by not getting yourself killed.

However, do take soft targets where they become available - a rogue's powerful attacks make them well equipped for catching small, out of position mages. Once you're a better judge of target softness you can start making riskier plays.

All rogues can lay traps like sleep traps or flash traps for blindness, which are potent, but be aware these will affect yourself and your team too! Be very careful how you use these.

## Mages

Small mages are almost defenseless in PK, having poor AC and no magical defenses like poets. To stay alive you will need to consider positioning **very** carefully, staying on the outskirts, keeping your team between you and the enemy mass. Stay near your team's poets - they will be better equipped to save you than allied fighters.

Even while completely out of range of the enemy team, you can provide quick Sanctuary to teammembers you see get dispeled, which can definitely save lives.

If you find yourself under attack by an invisible rogue, best not to assume you can kill the target - instead, use your doze to sleep them and run.

Morph spells can be helpful in disguising your softness - if the enemy has to take an extra moment to work out if they can easily kill you or not, they may lose the opportunity.

As a mage's initial curse Vex is weaker than a poet's Scourge, try to avoid using Vex unless you're absolutely sure you can kill the target entirely by yourself.

Once you have some additional attacks from marks, it helps to understand the different ways you can combine your attacks for different balances of speed, damage, and safety.

The best time to doze an enemy offensively is after you see a poet land a dispel. Dozing random targets in the middle of their team while protected by sanctuary is largely ineffective, although dozing a poet who has just cast harden body can lock them out of the game for the duration as they cannot be woken. You can also try to time your doze mid-way through a poet's HB so that they are still vulnerable while slept.

## Poets

Unlike other paths, even small poets can have a massive impact on the outcome if played well. This is because many poet capabilities are independent of stats. Poets have terrible AC, but Harden Body making you completely invulnerable to damage makes you a hard target without a coordinated (or extremely well timed) attack. Harden body has a fixed 50% success rate, so there can be a brief vulnerability window between recasts.

Don't take this as an excuse to stay close to the action - there's still lots of good you can do by staying safe on the outside. Given your importance, survival is paramount.

Poets have two primary functions:

- Defensive play, reactively casting Sanctuary and Atone (to remove curses) on players who have just been dispelled or cursed.
- And aggressive play, coordinating with your team to land dispel and then scourge on a target just before your team takes a shot.

You will need to balance these carefully - if your team is overwhelmed, or swamped with invisible rogues, focus on defensive play until the situation improves. Once you have a little space, try out some aggression.

Of course, try to heal members of your team that need it as you can. Poets are also not above using their heal to healout bigger members of their team.
