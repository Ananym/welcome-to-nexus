# Mythic Alliances

## Overview

Whether it's to improve your karma or to satisfy the requirements for your third [mark](character/marks.md), you will need to complete some Mythic Alliances sooner or later.

You can complete 6 lesser alliances, followed by 3 greater alliances. The third mark of strength, Sam-san, requires all three greater alliances to be completed. Beyond that, you can take on a Sublime alliance - though these currently serve no purpose besides additional karma.

Mythic alliances involve meeting a Mythic leader, accepting his request, then slaying the required enemies and returning to the leader with the necessary items. Despite being 'alliances', this will not change the behaviour of the creatures in the cave.

Finding the leader in most mythic caves involves falling into the guardroom by stepping onto a randomly selected tile in particular rooms. In most caves these tiles are one-use-only, and your allies will need to find another invisible fall tile. Once you arrive at the guardroom, you can make your way through a door to visit the leader. Mythic Rat is slightly different, in that you can reach the leader without needing to fall. Mythic Tiger is especially tricky as you can fall into many other rooms besides the guardroom, although these fall spots can last multiple uses.

Once at the leader, say the name of that cave's enemy out loud to start a lesser alliance. The enemy pairings are rabbit - rooster, monkey - tiger, dog - dragon, rat - horse, snake - pig, ox - sheep. If you've finished all your lesser alliances and have reached the rank of il-san, you can instead say "Greater" to start a greater alliance.

In either case, the leader will direct you to slay bosses from enemy caves. For a lesser alliance, you'll need to kill three item bosses (avengers) and three key bosses (spirits) of the leader's directly opposing cave. You'll also need to return with four of that cave's unique item and eight of that cave's unique key.

For a greater alliance, you'll need to invade two other caves chosen randomly from the pool of caves you're not allied with, in addition to the cave of the leader's natural enemy. The leader will now require five item and five key bosses from each cave - thirty bosses in total! Thankfully, greater alliances do not require you to sacrifice any keys or items.

Mythic boss kills for alliances are tracked independently from other kills - you don't need to worry about killing other creatures. Watch your status box as you slay each boss to confirm that the counter has increased, as this counter will be the one the leader checks.

Once you've slain all your bosses (and amassed your items, for a lesser alliance) return to the leader and again speak either the enemy's name for a lesser alliance or "greater" for a greater alliance to complete your task.

## Tips and Strategies

As you'll need to complete six Lesser Alliances, you'll need to pick a side from each of these pairs. Completing a Lesser Alliance awards a Mythic Favor specific to that cave. Some favors are more valuable as they are used for learning Sa-san spells - these are Tiger, Snake, Rooster, and Dragon. Rat is also a popular choice as it's easy to access the leader. This would just leave you with the choice of Ox vs Sheep for your final lesser alliance.

As you kill each boss, watch the status box for confirmation of the kill credit. Unfortunately, mythic bosses don't always properly credit you with the kill. There's not much you can do about this besides making sure it's focused on you at the moment it dies. Watching the kill counter in your status box will save you from making a trip to the leader that turns out to be useless due to a kill not being counted.

Marriage and Blood Oaths can make Alliances a much less frustrating experience, as only one of you needs to traverse the caves and only one of you needs to fall into the guardroom.

You can start all your Lesser Alliances at the same time - the kill counters don't overlap, so there shouldn't be an issue running them concurrently. You can only have one Greater Alliance in progress at a time, however.

Save a little time by starting your first Greater Alliance immediately with the leader with which you finished your six Lesser Alliances.

By exchanging Daily Coins at the incubator, you can pick up '[damaged orbs](combat/orbs.md)' letting you cast spells from other paths. They can't be used in groups and massively penalize experience and drop rates, but they can be a powerful tool for Alliances.

To take your third mark of strength, you need six Lesser and three Greater Alliances. That's a total of 126 boss kills - not to mention all the trips through guardrooms! Consider starting your alliances early so you're not faced with a gigantic hurdle at Sam-san.

However, be wary of moving between cave levels during Alliances. If you kill a boss twice in e.g. Mythic Monkey 2, then a third time in Mythic Monkey 3, the counters won't sum. You'll need to kill the required amount of each boss all in the same cave.

Inevitably, some of the bosses you fight during the course of your Alliances will make for difficult foes. Prepare yourself by bringing Scrolls of Protection, which pre-emptively block curses, and emergency healing like Red Potions.

Mythic Nexus is often populated by others working on their own alliances. Use Sage and world shouts to find one another and cooperate. People will appreciate your kindness if you check via Sage whether anyone else is also looking for a boss you've found before you kill it.

At busy times, there may be a group of adventurers coordinating to check different Mythic caves and share different bosses. Joining these groups when they're running can be an efficient way to make progress.

Mythic bosses respawn approximately every 40-60 minutes. However, this is a periodic check rather than a time since the boss was last slain - it's entirely possible for a boss to respawn moments after it died, if you managed to kill it just before this periodic check.
