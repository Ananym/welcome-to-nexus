# Beyond your 99th

It is wise to look beyond your 99th insight to see what obstacles lie further into your future. Many of these hurdles are made easier with some forward planning. The sheer number of hours spent training is rarely the limiting factor for moving forward.

At your 99th insight, you will be able to improve your vitality, mana, might, grace and will in exchange for experience. Watch out - if you perish at level 99, you will lose half of all the experience you are carrying.

Make sure you investigate [subpaths](community/community-subpath.md), as some paths require a subpath to function effectively after 99.

To join a totem subpath, or learn the warrior & rogue fighting techniques of a community subpath, you must sacrifice one billion experience.

If you can't make this sacrifice the moment you hit your 99th, you may wish to spend the experience on stats in the meantime and win a Bringer's Gift from a Riches carnage event. The Bringer's gift is available to anyone of the 99th insight and immediately awards 1b experience.

At certain milestones of strength, you can undertake trials to take a mark - these marks allow access to new spells and stronger equipment. You need only meet either the vitality or mana requirement to take a mark, not both.

These marks are:

- Il-san: 160/80 (160,000 vitality or 80,000 mana)
- Ee-san: 320/160
- Sam-san: 640/320
- Sa-san: 1280/640

**Il-san** is available at 160k vitality or 80k mana.

Its trials are straightforward and do not require a deep time investment.

---

**Ee-san** is available at 320k vitality or 160k mana, with at least Tiger karma.

Its main hurdle is the trial of culture, which requires that you reach Master in carpentry, tailoring, metalwork, or jewelling. Alternatively, you can pass with merely Accomplished in crafting if you collect 800 Daily coins (converted into Daily coin leaves). As daily coins are freely traded between players, you can use gold to build your collection faster than just collecting coins personally. Daily coins are the more typical approach to this trial.

If you want to pursue culture entirely through craft, Carpentry is regarded as the most accessible, though be prepared to get through 25,000 or more Ginko wood before you reach your goal.

**Sam-san** is available at 640k vitality or 320k mana, with at least Angel tear karma.

This mark has several taxing trials.

The trial of wisdom requires that you have the 5th level of Sage. Sage is first available from the wilderness sage at level 90, and is upgradable every 45 real days thereafter. It is recommended that you learn sage asap and keep on top of the wait timer, as this is often a significant barrier for aspiring ee-sans.

The trial of skill requires that you amass 60 carnage wins, with at least 5 of each type. Acquaint yourself with the carnage schedule, look out for rapid one-round line-ups on Saturdays, look out for free wins on holidays, look out for bonuses throughout the day. Fox hunts especially are quick to attend.

The trial of strength requires that you complete all 6 possible lesser alliances and all 3 possible greater alliances. This is a major undertaking. At the least, it will provide you with all the karma you require for the mark. Tackling some alliances early on can make this task less daunting.

---

**Sa-san** is available at 1280k vitality or 160k mana.

It requires that you've finished both your Sun and Wind armor quests, and have either completed Staff of Elements or spent the karma to create your own Faerie Light.

The trial of endurance requires you to have completed 400 minor quests. If you are meticulous with timing, two minor quests can be completed each day as the timer is 11.5 hours. At the time of writing, daily coins can be paid in to skip the minor quest delay timer at 4 coins per skip. If you are serious about reaching Sa-san in a timely fashion, you will want to make sure you complete your minor quests as often as possible, and collect daily coins regularly on all your characters.

The other trials include significant combat quests that the community generally bands together to help people complete.
