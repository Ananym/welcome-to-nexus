# Beyond your 99th

At your 99th insight, you will be able to improve your vitality, mana, might, grace and will in exchange for experience. Watch out - if you perish at level 99, you will lose half of all the experience you are carrying.

Your next steps from here involve taking [Marks](character/marks.md), starting with il-san which can be taken at 160k vitality or 80k mana. However, you should familiarise yourself with the mark requirements early - stats are rarely the obstacle for higher marks, and knowing the requirements in advance helps a lot!

## Subpaths

Make sure you investigate subpaths, as some paths - fighters in particular - require a subpath to function effectively after 99. You can choose between [Community-lead Subpaths](character/community-subpath.md), which involve training under a guide of that subpath, or your path's totem-focused [NPC Subpath](character/npc-subpath.md) which is not dependent on community interaction. You don't need to be level 99 to start training for a community subpath, but only level 99 players can join an NPC subpath.

To join an [NPC subpath](character/npc-subpath.md), or learn the warrior & rogue fighting techniques of a community subpath, you must sacrifice one billion experience, which you'll have already by the time you reach level 99. Be careful not to die or spend all your experience, or it may be a struggle to recover this amount!

If you do find yourself in this situation, you can pick up a Bringer's Gift by winning a [Riches carnage event](community/carnage-events.md). The Bringer's gift is available to anyone of the 99th insight and immediately awards 1b experience.

## Spending experience

Specific NPCs can improve your stats at the cost of experience. Most clans will have an NPC to offer this function - otherwise there is one found in each kingdom (e.g. Kugnae 78/187).

Might Will and Grace are all relatively cheap. Warriors and rogues should significantly invest (100+) in Might immediately and maximize it soon after. Mages should maximize their Will immediately. (It's not clear whether Poets see any meaningful benefit from Will, but they might as well.) Grace is cheap enough that everyone might as well maximize it at some point, but there's no great rush.

The balance between vitality and mana investment is a personal choice, but common advice starting out for every path is enough vitality to not worry about dying and the rest into mana. Mana helps fighters hit higher breakpoints for their incremental Rage/Cunning spells, helps Poets keep casting and offer bigger Restores, helps mages hit harder. Mages can also commit to hunting in a group and focus on vitality early for a stress-free experience.

You can find the tables for fighter mana breakpoints in [Hunting](combat/hunting.md).

Poets specifically should be looking at picking up their [Restore](quests/restore.md) spell once they reach the ~25k vitality range to avoid being onehit in Tiger palace.
