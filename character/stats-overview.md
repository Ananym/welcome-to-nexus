# Stats Overview

Combat in NexusTK is governed by a handful of different statistics.

_Please appreciate that NexusTK's core systems were designed in ~1996 for a very different game, one that generally stayed below level 99. Many of the mechanisms behind these stats start to break down beyond 99, and the decisions behind monster stats and gear stats have not always been well-founded._

**Vitality and Mana** allow you to take hits and cast spells. They also directly determine the power of your strongest techniques like Whirlwind and Hellfire.

**Weapon damage** - the damage range on your current weapon. Only used for normal swings. The 'S' value is always applicable, the 'L' value has no known purpose. Warrior and rogue ingresses directly multiply your weapon damage.

**AC**, or armor class, directly reduces incoming damage. Negative AC is better: -60 AC will reduce incoming damage by 60%. AC caps in effect at -80 for players, but you may wish to go lower to pre-emptively counteract curses in the arena or penalties from warrior rages. Monster AC caps in effect at -95. AC also influences a target's chance to dodge incoming blows.

**'Dam'** improves your base damage by a flat amount. This makes a big difference early on, but becomes quickly less important as you gain [marks](character/marks.md). Rogues get slightly more use out of Dam than warriors, as Dam's effect is multiplied by a rogue's invisibility whereas a warrior's damage originates from powerful ingresses that don't interact with Dam.

**'Hit'** improves your ability to hit enemies with swings. This makes a big difference early on, but no longer matters much beyond your 99th insight, once you max out your Might stat.

**Might** improves both your ability to hit and your base damage, if only slightly. Having enough also enables you to equip certain weapons.

**Grace** improves your ability to dodge incoming blows.

**Will** improves your ability to cast certain spells without failing (and very very slightly increases the damage of your basic zap attack spells).

**Protection** gives offensive spells a chance to fail when used against you. This appears to be 10% per point of protection, capping at 70%, so there is no advantage going beyond 7 protection.

**Regen/Healing** directly improves the amount of vitality you regenerate over time by a percentage. 1 regen improves your natural regeneration by 1%. There is no equivalent for mana. This stat is usually not significant outside of niche solo scenarios.

## Stat Priorities

For the most part, weapon damage is valued most highly for warriors and rogues while they hunt using basic swings. AC is still important for keeping incoming damage to a managable level, especially for warriors who take penalties to AC while raging.

Beyond that, AC is paramount in the arena. The way AC scales means each point of negative AC is more relatively impactful than the last, so the strongest possible defensive items are very highly prized.

Having at least 7 protection is very important for arena events, but this is very easily reached and more than that doesn't appear to help you at all.

Many arena events cap your base vitality and mana to a certain level. This makes big vitality and mana bonuses on equipment valuable, as these stats directly govern your offense with your powerful techniques. Swings are rarely employed in the arena.

Once you reach your 99th insight, you can very easily raise your might, will, and grace to high levels. Spells stop failing, swings stop missing. Hit no longer matters at this point, as a warrior or rogue with maxed might almost never misses a typical target.

Once you start taking marks like Il-san and beyond, you gain access to stronger ingresses and stronger weapons. The values of Dam on gear don't scale nearly as quickly, so it becomes quickly irrelevant.

Might, will, and grace, generally don't do any noticeable good in the amounts found on gear - although mages may appreciate large will bonuses while levelling to improve their casting success rate.
