# Karma explanation

Karma represents the virtue of your soul. It's influenced by quests and your interactions with others, and you will need to demonstrate enough of this inner virtue to harness power beyond the mundane world - such as the celestial armors and Bonhwa's marks.

In practice, karma is represented by a single value. Some quests and interactions will grant karma, some will cost karma, and some will require that you have enough karma to continue.

Members of the Monk, Geomancer, and Diviner subpaths can peer into your soul and get an idea of your current karma level. Certain NPCs can also perform this service, but for a fee of 15k. These readings will visualize your karma as an animal, each representing a range of actual karma values.

Your karma can fall as well as rise. Should you drop to the level of Snake, you run the risk of NPCs refusing to talk to you until you redeem yourself. In these rare but dire circumstances, you may turn to the Monks to seek forgiveness.
