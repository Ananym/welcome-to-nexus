# NPC Subpath Information

Join a totem subpath if you have no interest in joining one of the community subpaths. The totem subpaths are quick to join and ask very little of you, but don't have the same to offer in terms of spell variety or social opportunities.

(At the time of writing, PC warriors have extra vita attacks useful in arenas but much worse swing damage at Sam-san and beyond than NPC warriors. This kind of discrepancy is not shared by any other path.)

To begin, you'll need to speak the language of dogs.

You must speak to each path dog in turn, without saying anything else - not even speaking to innkeepers to travel between kingdoms.

Outside Kugnae's taverns: find the Mutt of the Rogues, and say "Hello!" out loud.

Then respond in kind with "Bark!"

Next, find the Jindo Dog of the mages, east of Buya's fox cave.

Say "Bark!", and follow up with "Woof!"

Next, find the Hunting Dog of the warriors outside Kugnae's fox cave.

Greet him with "Woof!", and follow up with "Grrowl!"

Finally, visit the Spotted Dog of the poets, northwest corner of Buya, outside the walls.

Say "Grrowl!", and you will have completed your mastery of the dogs' language.

At this point, return to your path's dog and say "Secret". You'll be asked to dedicate yourself to the dogs, swearing off the community subpaths. Changing your mind will incur a karma penalty. The dogs offer some spells of their own, but at the time of writing they're not tremendously impactful.

You'll also need the blessing of a being known as the Watcher.

For this, you'll require Ox karma. Some quests grant karma, as do Mythic Alliances. Pirate coins can also be traded in for karma at libraries. Monks, geomancers, and diviners can check your karma for you, or you can pay a small fee to certain characters.

Once you've reached Ox karma, visit the rabbit fields in the northwest of Buya, outside the walls. Walk around briefly. You'll soon catch the watcher's eye. It's recommended to get this step out of the way as soon as possible if you are definitely joining your totem path, as once you are blessed you can use that karma for the celestial armor quests.

Once you've reached your 99th insight, you can progress.

Visit Baek, the scribe in the northwest of Kugnae.

Say the name of your path's totem god to him, out loud:

Chung Ryong for warriors,

Baekho for rogues,

Hyun Moo for poets,

Ju Jak for mages.

Bring him a favor from a mythic alliance (though be careful, as Dragon/Snake/Rooster/Tiger are much more valuable than the others) in addition to 10 Splendid tiger pelts and a billion experience.

Baek will take these items and cement the pact between you and your totem god.

Some further items will be required to learn your totem god's spell.

Abandoning any subpath incurs a heavy karma penalty - be careful!
