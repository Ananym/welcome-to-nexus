# Community Subpath Information

Each path has three community subpaths that are run by others, and a fourth more solitary subpath devoted to the path's totem god. These are usually called PC subpaths and NPC subpaths respectively.

Both PC and NPC subpaths offer spells beyond the regular path spell list. Some of these spells are common to all subpaths, and are generally important for further progress, especially for some paths. Warriors and rogues need to take a path to learn their swing damage spells at 99 and above, while mages need to take a path to learn their advanced heals at il-san and above. Poets can still function without a path without suffering much.

PC Subpaths also have their own unique spells - some of these are just for fun, some of these do provide utility in hunting or arena events. These spells are to at least some extent considered secret, and you will not find them listed publicly.

(At the time of writing, PC warriors have extra vita attacks useful in arenas but much worse swing damage at Sam-san and beyond than NPC warriors. This kind of discrepency is not shared by any other path.)

Participating in a PC subpath is a very rewarding experience - you'll develop friendships and specialised knowledge, and enjoy some unique playstyle benefits. However, community subpaths ask a lot in return. You'll need to form a relationship with a subpath guide and undergo training to enter, and you'll likely be expected to be able to act in-character. The kinds of activities involved in training and the level of strictness around roleplaying varies among the subpaths.

You need to be level 50 to join a PC subpath, but as training takes time, it's never too early to start.

The process for joining each subpath is different, but some general hints:

Start by examining their posts on the subpaths board. Try to track down their scroll from a library, their public area, or one of the subpath members. (You do need to be registered to hold the subpath scrolls.) Learn the basics of the path from their scroll, then politely make yourself known to one of the subpath guides. Some subpaths accept direct applications, some subpaths will invite you when they feel you are ready.
