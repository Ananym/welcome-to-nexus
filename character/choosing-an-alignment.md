# Choosing an Alignment

Your alignment is a fairly minor decision in the development of your character, but you shouldn't forget to do it.
Choosing your alignment is possible at level 45. Alignment affects the names and visuals of your spells, and also mechanically affects certain spells.
For mages and poets, choosing any alignment at all will reduce your invoke aethers by a few seconds. This is a good reason to take your alignment early.
For warriors, taking a non-kwi-sin alignment is imperative to using Whirlwind safely.

There are three alignments to choose from:

- Ming-ken, life-aligned
  Tends to have bold effects. Found in the Islets east of Buya. Fighter attack visuals modelled after animal claws.
  For poets, their resurrection spell becomes a 5-way AoE. This is helpful in some niche circumstances and unhelpful in some niche circumstances.
  For warriors, their Whirlwind is modified to the safe version, dropping you to 10% of your vitality instead of a flat 10.

- Ohaeng, balance-aligned
  Found in the Wilderness between Buya and Kugnae.
  For warriors, their Whirlwind is modified to the safe version, dropping you to 10% of your vitality instead of a flat 10.

- Kwi-sin, death-aligned
  Tends to have spookier effects.
  For warriors, their whirlwind gets a slight damage boost, but continues to drop you to a flat 10 vitality, making it poorly compatible with living.

Choosing an alignment is not an initially arduous process - visit the shrine, complete the quiz, then visit your guildmaster and announce the name of your alignment out loud. This will, however, change the names of your spells to terms altogether less straightforward - you'll need to relearn the ones you use! Websites like NexusAtlas can help you work this out.
