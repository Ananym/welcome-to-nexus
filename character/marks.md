# Marks

At certain milestones of strength, you can undertake trials to take a mark - these marks allow access to new spells and stronger equipment. You need only meet either the vitality or mana requirement to take a mark, not both.

These marks are:

- Il-san: 160/80 (160,000 vitality or 80,000 mana)
- Ee-san: 320/160
- Sam-san: 640/320
- Sa-san: 1280/640

## Bonhwa

To access these marks, you need to find the mysterious Bonhwa. Reaching Bonhwa involves fighting through a swarm of blinding ravens and then the Forever Tree, a passive enemy that has a huge amount of health. Find some strong help, then visit 19/92 in the Wilderness.

Besides granting marks, Bonhwa will also let marked characters enchant certain weapons at the cost of 200m experience. This is first available before il-san, at 80k/40k. Enchanted spikes, charms, surges, and bloods make for varyingly usable weapons in a pinch, and are also used as components for spells and shields. For more on enchanting, see [Equipment](character/99-equipment.mdid=enchantment).

Bonhwa does also allow you to spend experience to raise your Might/Grace/Will beyond their natural limits. This doesn't really achieve anything useful.

## Available Marks

### Il-san

**Il-san** is available at 160k vitality or 80k mana.

Its trials are straightforward and do not require a deep time investment:

- Acquire and sacrifice 5 well-crafted white ambers
- Acquire and sacrifice 600k coins
- Acquire and sacrifice 1.2 billion experience
- Slay the Spirit Rat boss in Mythic Rat (people love to help with this)

### Ee-san

**Ee-san** is available at 320k vitality or 160k mana, with at least Tiger karma.

Its main hurdle is the trial of culture, which requires that you reach Master in carpentry, tailoring, metalwork, or jewelling. Alternatively, you can pass with merely Accomplished in crafting if you collect 800 [Daily Coins](economy/daily-coins.md) (converted into Daily coin leaves). As daily coins are freely traded between players, you can buy these from others to build your collection faster than just collecting daily coins personally. Daily coins are the more typical approach to this trial.

If you want to pursue culture entirely through [crafting](economy/crafting.md), Carpentry is regarded as by far the most accessible (as carpentry skips the 'manufacturing' step), though be prepared to get through 25,000 or more Ginko wood before you reach your goal.

Other trials for this mark include:

- Another sacrifice of 1.2 billion experience
- A sacrifice of 2 million coins
- 6 carnage victories
- [Ee Strength](quests/ee-strength.md): A quest to slay both leaders of eight different mythic caves

### Sam-san

**Sam-san** is available at 640k vitality or 320k mana, with at least Angel tear karma.

This mark has several taxing trials.

- The trial of wisdom requires that you have the 5th level of Sage. Sage is first available from the wilderness sage (125/7) at level 90 at a cost of 100k, and is upgradable every 45 real days thereafter. It is recommended that you learn sage asap and keep on top of the wait timer, as this is often a significant barrier for aspiring sam-sans.

- The trial of skill requires that you amass 60 [carnage](community/carnage-events.md) wins, with at least 5 of each type. Acquaint yourself with the carnage schedule, look out for rapid one-round line-ups on Saturdays, look out for free wins on holidays, look out for bonuses throughout the day. Fox hunts especially are quick to attend.

- The trial of strength requires that you complete all 6 possible [lesser alliances](character/mythic-alliances.md) and all 3 possible [greater alliances](character/mythic-alliances.md). This is a major undertaking. At the least, it will provide you with all the karma you require for the mark. Tackling some alliances early on can make this task less daunting.

- A sacrifice of 2.4 billion experience
- A sacrifice of 4 million coins

### Sa-san

**Sa-san** is available at 1280k vitality or 640k mana.

- You must have finished both your Sun and Wind armor quests

_Bonhwa will take your completed armors from you, but at the time of writing, you can restore them immediately using the Kruna 'Bonded Item Restore' from the Item Shop_

- You must have either completed Staff of Elements or spent the karma to create your own Faerie Light.

- You will also need to sacrifice 200k vitality or 100k mana, in addition to 10 billion experience. You must still meet the Sa-san stat requirement after sacrificing! However, for the stat sacrifice, other players are able to sacrifice stats to Bonhwa in your name.

- The trial of endurance requires you to have completed 400 minor quests. If you are meticulous with timing, two minor quests can be completed each day as the timer is 11.5 hours. At the time of writing, daily coins can be paid in to skip the minor quest delay timer at 4 coins per skip. If you are serious about reaching Sa-san in a timely fashion, you will want to make sure you complete your minor quests as often as possible, and collect daily coins regularly on all your characters.

- The trials of Skill and Persistence include significant combat quests that the community generally bands together to help people complete.
