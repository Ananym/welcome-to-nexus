# Minor Quests

Minor quests are randomly generated quests that involve you tracking down a specific creature and slaying one of their number.

- To accept a minor quest, say "quest" out loud to your path guildmaster (Clan NPCs or the Buya Incubator attendant can also help with this)
- You can look up the location of your target at [NexusAtlas](https://nexusatlas.com/quests/minorquestlocations.php)
- You can confirm the target's name in your status box with ';' while facing or Right click (shift+r to toggle right click look)
- Poets might struggle to deal with bigger targets by themselves
- Slay the target, then return and say "complete"
- Minor quests can be repeated every 11.5 hours, and have no time limit
- You can check your current minor quest target in your character's legend (select yourself and switch pages)

## Rewards

- Completing a minor quest grants a small amount of experience that scales with your character
- It adds to your total minor quests completed record, which needs to reach 400 to acquire the last mark in the current progression, [Sa-san](character/marks.md)
- If you are [Registered](basics/registration.md) and under level 99, you will receive a Little Wony's Modulator if you haven't received one in the last 24 (23.5?) hours. This item lasts eight hours, and holding it doubles all experience gained.

## Cancelling

- If you really don't want to deal with the target, you can say 'cancel'
- This will cancel your minor quest and lock you out of more quests for a couple of days.

## Skipping the timer

- If you are trying to finish your Sa-san trials, you have the option of paying 4 [daily coins](economy/daily-coins.md) at the Incubator to skip your MQ timer.
- This option will be available in the Incubator attendant's menu if your MQ cooldown is currently running.
- These skipped-timer MQs will not reward experience, but will contribute to the 400 quests complete requirement.
- There may still be a limit on this feature related to the age of your character.
- Alongside Ee culture, this is one of the uses that give daily coins their value.
