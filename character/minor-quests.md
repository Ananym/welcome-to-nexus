# Minor Quests

Minor quests are randomly generated quests that involve you tracking down a specific creature and slaying one of their number.

- To accept a minor quest, say "quest" out loud to your path guildmaster
- Clan NPCs or the Buya Incubator attendent can also help with this
- You can look up the location of your target at [NexusAtlas](https://nexusatlas.com/quests/minorquestlocations.php)
- Poets might struggle to deal with bigger targets by themselves
- Slay the target, then return and say "complete"
- Minor quests can be repeated every 11.5 hours, and have no time limit
- You can check your current minor quest target in your character's legend (select yourself and switch pages)

## Rewards

- Completing a minor quest grants a small amount of experience
- It adds to your total minor quests completed record, which needs to reach 400 to acquire the last mark in the current progression, [Sa-san](character/beyond-99th.md)
- If you are [Registered](basics/registration.md) and under level 99, you will receive a Little Wony's Modulator if you haven't received one in the last 24 (23.5?) hours. This item lasts eight hours, and holding it doubles all experience gained.

## Cancelling

- If you really don't want to deal with the target, you can say 'cancel'
- This will cancel your minor quest and lock you out of more quests for a couple of days.
