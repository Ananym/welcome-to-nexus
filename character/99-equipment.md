# Equipment at 99 and beyond

This page is a quick rundown of what you should consider using at 99. As much as I wanted to just write a list per path, this is going to be slightly more freeform.

There are really two primary goals here - as much AC as possible up to your personal cap of -80, and as much damage output as achievable for fighters. The smaller stats aren't very significant at level 99, and while extra vitality/mana can help, it's usually more expensive on gear than is really worth thinking about.

Several details inform the thinking around AC:

- Warriors can easily achieve -80 AC base, but their Rage spell (and some weapons) inflict an AC penalty - meanwhile they regularly set themselves to 10% vitality with whirlwind. This gives warriors good reason to invest in AC for hunting.
- Other paths have weaker AC than warriors: generally, Warriors > Rogues > Mages > Poets.
- Rogues can and usually should try to achieve -80 AC base, but this isn't too hard.
- Mages do benefit from investing in AC for personal safety, but given the crowd-control power of mage spells, this is less important if you play well.
- Poets do benefit from investing in AC for personal safety, especially if they prioritise buying mana over vitality. However, as the poet spell Harden Body renders them immune to all damage, it takes very little for them to stay safe in most caves.
- In carnage events, as a rule any hard target will be cursed during an attack, which considerably degrades your AC. This is why people pay incredible amounts for the highest possible AC gear - pushing your AC far beyond the -80 cap will provide an effective buffer against curses. This factor largely does not affect typical hunting.

## Helms

- **Clan helm**: -10 AC, bought from your clan for 10k, perfectly fine.
- **Amber Casque**: -11 AC, only slightly expensive, slight improvement (all amber colours are equivalent)
- **Macerated Diadem**: -13 AC, will cost several million

See above notes on AC.

## Armor

After running out of armor from kingdom shops (or the warrior tiger armor questline), you need to look at the Star/Moon/Sun armor quests from your guildmaster. These are available at different levels, and require karma to start and involve karma costs to complete.

The specific quests vary per path, with guides available on NexusAtlas.

If taking an NPC subpath, you may wish to delay these quests until after you are 'blessed' to make it easier to reach that particular karma threshold.

You will need to complete all of these quests eventually to finish your Mark progression. In the meantime, finish as many as required to meet your personal AC goals.

Wind Armor is a separate quest. Wind armor offers some smaller stats, but generally nothing that matters, and has worse AC than sun.

## Hands

**Warriors**: Ambrosia. Powerful, but break on death - learn not to die!

**Rogues**: Level 99 rogues are in the rare position of benefiting meaningfully from Dam - they may wish to seek out high 'Dam' hand items like New Luck Amulets, which offer both Dam and AC. There are several cheaper options for rogues, from Black Rings which just offer AC, to Tuna wizard eyes which offer zero AC (recommended only with a mage!) but 5 dam, to Lucky silver coins which balance both.

**Mages and Poets**: For a cheaper option, consider Hamgyong Jelly Lumps for -7 AC, or just plain Purple rings for -5 AC. You can also invest in several New vortex items if you want a chunkier mana bonus, but this isn't required.

**For all paths**: You can find Corrupted rings for -12 AC. These are also break on death and slightly expensive, while degrading your mana. Not many people feel the need to invest in these but they are an option if you feel the need to push your AC further.

## Shields

After completing your path-specific Nagnang guild quest, you can run the Nagnag Armory quest to earn your shield. Most people delay their first Nagnag armory run until 99+ to receive the 97+ shield with help from level 99 players. <99s, level 99 players, and il-san+ players will enter different tiers of Nagnag armory. Not everybody bothers to collect a shield immediately or update their shield for every mark, depending on how happy they are with their current AC investment.

## Subaccessories

Subaccessories provide small amounts of stats and AC. Generally speaking all subaccessories within a rank offer the same AC while the small stats are inconsequential, so it barely matters which you use - buy the cheapest you can find! However, most subaccessories originate from past events and are fairly expensive. Do not feel obliged to invest in these.

There is the Floret Pendant acquired from a Tangun quest for -1 AC, plus the repeat-questable but BoD Gruff Rings also for -1 AC. I wouldn't personally recommend bothering with these, it simply won't make enough of a difference to your experience to be worth the time.

## Weapons

**Warriors**: Cheap option, titanium blade. Expensive option, cutlass skully (BoD!). The level 99 flamespear has its uses but those uses are mostly 'leeching people in atg1/2', as a weapon in more typical caves it doesn't meaningfully outdo the cutlass. Notably the level 99 warrior etched spear from the taik'pae quest is dreadful, never make this thing. Similarly, both Chung Ryong scale and enchanted Chung Ryong scale are outclassed by the cheap titanium blade.

**Rogues**: Cheap option, blood/nimble blade. Expensive option, cutlass skully. It doesn't hurt to carry a polearm (or featherlight) if hunting with a mage. Strictly speaking the 99 Rogue Etched Blade from the Taik'pae quest is the strongest level 99 weapon, but 99 through il-san generally doesn't last long enough for most people to be willing to wait for the ten days involved in the quest.

**Casters**: Both poets and mages only really benefit from the mana on weapons, and weapons with large mana bonuses are very expensive and generally not affordable as a new player. A charm or surge will do just fine, as would NPC path weapons. As with rogues, the taik'pae etched weapons quest will let you access high-mana weapons with a low pricetag, but most people don't bother going to this level of effort for the 99-through-to-il-san period. Mages have a slightly stronger argument for chasing mana items than poets, since mages do benefit significantly from hitting the mana breakpoints where their attacks onehit monsters.
