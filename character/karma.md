# Karma

## What is Karma?

Karma represents the virtue of your soul. It's influenced by quests and your interactions with others, and you will need to demonstrate enough of this virtue to harness divine powers like the celestial armors and Bonhwa's marks.

In practice, karma is represented by a single value. Some quests and interactions will grant karma, some will cost karma, and some will require that you have enough karma to continue.

Members of the Monk, Geomancer, and Diviner subpaths can peer into your soul and get an idea of your current karma level. Certain NPCs can also perform this service, but for a fee of 15k. These readings will represent your karma as an animal, corresponding to the tier your karma value is in.

Your karma can fall as well as rise. If you drop to Snake tier, NPCs may refuse to talk to you until you redeem yourself - this is something the Monks can help you achieve.

## Karma Chart

Because the reading of karma is an imprecise art, this chart of karma levels isn't perfect. However, it should give you an idea of the effort required between where you are and where you want to be.

The smallest unit of karma recognised by the community is the pirate coin, as pirate coins can be directly exchanged for karma with librarians. Pirate coins are acquired through quests on Gogoon island, as well as some temporary events.

New characters appear to start at the low end of Cat, so this is taken as zero.

The number of total pirate coins' worth of karma to reach each rank from Cat is approximately as follows:

### Karma Levels

- **Cat**: 0
- **Squirrel**: 4
- **Rabbit**: 9
- **Dog**: 14
- **Monkey**: 21
- **Ox**: 29
- **Bear**: 39
- **Tiger**: 59
- **Dragon**: 89
- **Spirit**: 124
- **Angel's Tear**: 199
- **Angel**: 350

You will also see other guides and players talk about 'points' of karma - this refers to the amount of karma granted by Mentor, which is a system that no longer exists. One 'point' is worth 8 pirate coins of karma.

### One-Time Karma Sources

Some ways to bolster your karma are only available once. These include:

- Aiding Chu Rua
- Talking to Majhum about the Dusk Shaman during the Nagnag armory quest
- Weaving a magical net during the Wind armor quest
- Specializing in a manufacturing skill
- The nonrepeatable quests on Gogoon island, particularly Zuhair's Important Letter
- Mythic alliances, of which you can complete 6 Lessers, 3 Majors, and 1 Sublime

In general, aiding Chu Rua, talking to Majhum, and finishing the Important Letter quest will give you enough karma / pirate coins to reach Ox, which is an important breakpoint for the blessing required by NPC subpaths. You may wish to delay your path celestial armor quests until after receiving this blessing, as those quests do consume karma to complete.

### Repeatable Karma Sources

Other sources of karma are repeatable. These are generally small in value. Examples include:

- Sacrificing a gold acorn to your totem at the wilderness shrines (daily)
- Completing the Wisdom test at your path guild (every three weeks)
- Taking karma as a carnage prize
- Placing in revels or story contests
- Saying "Happy birthday" to Maya outside Kugnae's SunMoon clan (weekly)
- Minor quests, randomly
- While spending experience, randomly
- Repeatable gathering quests on Gogoon
- Some repeatable subpath community quests
