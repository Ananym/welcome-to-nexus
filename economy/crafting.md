# Crafting

*Lmao don't*

The current state of crafting is not a path to making money or useful items, and involves an enormous amount of time and resources to make much progress. It is entirely viable to completely ignore crafting beyond the bare minimum, and this does have to be my recommendation.

There is one profession that produces an item with genuine value: the diadem, produced by jewellers, which boasts the strongest armor class of any helm. As this item is effectively best in slot and incredibly difficult to make, the demand/supply is there for it to hold its worth. Reaching the point of even attempting to craft one of these will cost many hundreds of millions of coins.

That said, investing in crafting to some degree is required for some pursuits, and it doesn't hurt to reach a level where you can produce basic goods that people often need like metal, cloth, fine steel daggers. Gaining experience in crafting involves repeatedly performing that skill - for manufacturing and refining, only successes count. 

- You can only specialise in one manufacturing skill, others will be capped at a certain rank
- You can only devote yourself to one refining skill, you must devote to practice a refining skill at all
- Most clans provide easier ways to access some of the crafting options and locations
- Different paths advance at slightly different rates through the skills
- Crafting during the game-hours of the day that match your totem will give you a (very) slight boost to crafting experience gain
- [Kruna](economy/kruna.md) crafting bags exist to allow you to hold more materials at a time

## Gathering

### Woodcutting

Buy (many) axes from Splinter at 136/188 in the Wilderness and swing them at trees in a grove, such as the one in south of the Wilderness at 111/178. There's no way to speed this up or decrease axe break rate.

### Mining

Buy a pick and shovel from Thane at 185/20 in the Wilderness. Walk around the rocky ground, dropping and picking up your shovel on every spot, until a popup prompts you to drop and pick up your axe. Clans cannot currently have mining fields.

### Fishing

Visit a fishing NPC (e.g. outside Kugnae's fox cave) and say 'fish'. Different combinations of rod and bait produce different results.

### Farming

Visit Ssal in Kugnae at 111/140 and buy a basic sickle. Walk around the farm ground with the sickle equipped and respond to the (rare) prompts. If a plant leans in a direction, cut that way.

### Wool, ambers, etc

There's no gathering skill for these. Kill sheep for wool, various creatures for ambers.

## Manufacturing

*The game considers these skills "Manufacturing", even though you are not manufacturing finished goods but instead refining raw materials into refined materials...*

### Smelting

Acquire a bunch of ore - when starting out, low and medium grade ore will be nearly useless, you need the good ore. Buy a Smelting Agreement from a Kingdom Messenger, then visit Gruff Smith in Sanhae just off Northern pass (Arctic land on the world map). Say 'smelt'. If prompted to use more material, saying 'no' will produce Slag, which has its own uses.

### Weaving

Acquire a bunch of wool. Acquire fine weaving tools (made by carpenters, effectively valueless) Visit Yon in the Wilderness at 44/30 and say 'weave'.

### Gemcutting

Acquire a bunch of ambers. Visit Sel in the Wilderness at 46/42 and say 'gem'. Tarnished ambers can be sold to Kingdom Ring shops.

## Refining

*To start using a refining skill, you must first specialise with the appropriate NPC for that skill*

*Some products of refining skills can be sold to NPCs to partially recoup losses.*

### Metalworking

Acquire a bunch of metal. Visit a Kingdom smith. Say 'metal'. If prompted for more materials, saying 'no' will produce Spent Metal, which has its own uses. Daggers are considered the most efficient way to advance. High rank metalworkers can produce the titanium blade and its successors.

### Carpentry

Acquire a bunch of wood. Visit Splinter in the wilderness at 136/188 and say 'wood'. If prompted for more materials, saying 'no' will produce Wood Scraps, which have their own uses. Weaving tools are considered the most efficient way to advance. High rank carpenters can produce several ranks of polearm.

### Tailoring

Acquire a bunch of cloth. Visit the tailor shop in Sanhae village and say 'cloth'. High rank tailors can produce several ranks of defensive fan.

### Jewelling

Acquire a bunch of crafted amber, as well as an enormous amount of coins. Visit Sel in the wilderness at 46/42 and say 'jewel'.  Each attempt will cost coins as well as amber. High rank jewellers can make a wide variety things, of which only diadems are seriously valuable. 

## Mental Skills

*Only mages and poets can participate in these skills, and can only pick one.*

### Scribing

Ascend Scribe's mountain in the vale and talk to the Sage. Scribing produces consumable scrolls from various materials, some of which have a little value in bulk.

### Alchemy

Ascend Scribe's mountain in the vale and talk to the Sage. Alchemy produces consumable potions from various materials, although largely not very valuable.

## Cooking

*Everyone can do these, I believe they're not counted as any other skill type.*

### Food Preparation

Acquire preparable food items, such as fish, (non-lean) beef, chicken, egg, wheat. Visit Min's Butcher in Hausson and say 'prepare x'. Preparing wheat produces flour.

### Cheffing

Must be accomplished in food prep. Chef primarily exists to create Noodles, which only have utility for certain events. There are some other chef activities on gogoon.
