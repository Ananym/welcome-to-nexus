# Kruna

You will likely run into people trading Kruna. Here's what's going on.

Kruna is the microtransaction currency. The items on offer are cosmetic or for utility purposes. There is generally nothing that directly increases your strength, but some items can be quite important all the same. All dealings with Kruna require you to be registered.

To browse the kruna shop or purchase items, browse to https://nexustk.com, access the item shop via the sidebar, and log in with your [NexusTK account details](basics/registration.md) (not character details).

To acquire more kruna, visit the coupon shop and purchase a kruna coupon instead of a registration coupon. This coupon can be used inside the item shop to add kruna to your account balance.

All Kruna purchases can take roughly 5-10 minutes to arrive, at which point you can receive them at your kingdom or clan messenger.

In-game, Shift-F9 can be used to preview the currently available kruna cosmetics. Cosmetic items bought directly generally cannot be traded between players or characters.

The kruna shop also sells a rotation of mystery boxes. Some of these boxes contain packages of cosmetic items which _can_ themselves be traded, as long as they haven't been opened.

Utility items to be aware of:

- Permanent extra inventory or bank slots
- Consumable equipment restoration that repairs all equipped items without coin cost
- Consumable world shouts, letting you yell across all kingdoms on a 5 minute timer
- Consumable layers of Item Protection to prevent fragile items breaking upon death
- Temporary envelopes, letting you store experience beyond the natural cap for a period of time
- Crafting material bags letting you hold additional stacks of wood, wool, ore, ambers, etc.

You can also buy registration codes via the Kruna store, for gifting purposes. It is strongly recommended that you do NOT trade registration codes directly, i.e. do not send the actual text code instead of using the kruna gift system - this can put your account at risk of being affected by payment issues.

Kruna trading takes place via gifting. Your account must be at least three months old to send gifts. There is an additional fee for sending gifts.

Note that while selling Kruna is very lucrative compared to simply gathering crafting materials or collecting mythic boss drops, there are many billions of coins in the NexusTK economy. Trying to become 'rich' by NTK standards through the sale of Kruna alone would cost you an incomprehensible amount of money, so mind that you don't get taken advantage of.
