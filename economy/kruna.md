# Kruna

You will likely run into people trading Kruna. Here's what's going on.

Kruna is the microtransaction currency. The items on offer are cosmetic or for utility purposes. There is generally nothing that directly increases your strength, but some items can be quite important all the same. All dealings with Kruna require you to be registered.

All Kruna purchases can take roughly 5-10 minutes to arrive, at which point you can receive them at your kingdom or clan messenger.

Utility items to be aware of:

- Permanent extra inventory or bank slots
- Consumable equipment restoration that repairs all equipped items without coin cost
- Consumable world shouts, letting you yell across all kingdoms on a 5 minute timer
- Consumable layers of Item Protection to prevent fragile items breaking upon death
- Temporary envelopes, letting you store experience beyond the natural cap for a period of time
- Crafting material bags letting you hold additional stacks of wood, wool, ore, ambers, etc.

You can also buy registration codes via the Kruna store, for gifting purposes.

Kruna trading takes place via gifting. Your account must be at least three months old to send gifts. There is an additional fee for sending gifts.

Note that while selling Kruna is very lucrative compared to simply gathering crafting materials or collecting mythic boss drops, there are many billions of coins in the NexusTK economy. Trying to become 'rich' by NTK standards through the sale of Kruna alone would cost you an incomprehensible amount of money, so mind that you don't get taken advantage of.
