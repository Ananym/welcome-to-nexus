# Trading

This page covers the different ways people trade within NTK.

## Finding a trader

For everyday items, people often announce what they're looking for using the Sage spells (starting level 90) or World Shouts. Registered characters can World Shout once an hour for free using the orb available from the inns, or you can buy consumable World Shouts from the [kruna](economy/kruna.md) store to shout more often. If you don't have access to these, you can always go somewhere busy like West Gate Kugnae and ask if anyone is willing to shout for you.

(If you're shouting about buying an item, do yourself a favor and stand somewhere where you're easy to find! Staying in sight can encourage people to help you who might not have bothered to whisper. Similarly avoid shouting that you're buying something then immediately going AFK, in case someone just drops the item for you and you miss it.)

You can also browse the [Buy and Sell boards](community/boards.md) boards for longer term information on what people want or have to offer.

As world shouts and buy/sell posts are both mirrored to the unofficial NTK discord, searching there can be a good way to find information on who's selling what, or what price some item typically goes for.

## Exchange System

Trades of normal quantities of an item are performed through the exchange system. You'll need to meet your partner in person, then one of you will press Shift+E to enable their exchange setting while the other initiates the exchange using the button available when clicking on a player.

The exchange interface can feel slightly clunky. Tips:

* 'h'anding an item to another player will attempt to open an exchange window with that item prefilled
* You can also hand then press the '/' key to open an exchange with a prefilled amount of gold
* You can hold Ctrl while selecting items to add to exchange to insert multiple entries at once

Once you're happy with the state of the proposed trade, click Ok. Note that the exchange may close unsuccessfully if you both click Ok simultaneously - if this happens, you'll need to re-enable exchange and try again.

## Mass Exchange

If you need to trade bigger quantities than normally fit into your inventory at once, you can use Mass Exchange to trade directly between players' banks. This also skips any banking fees involved in depositing traded items. To use Mass Exchange, visit a marketplace NPC - typically people use the Huntyr memorial NPC in Kugnae Gathering by the north gate. One of you should volunteer to start the mass exchange, then proceed carefully through the mass exchange dialogue flow until their side of the trade is ready. Once your partner completes their half, the trade will be performed automatically, with results shown in the status message box.

## Parcels and Checks

While not typically used for commerce, parcels are another way of transferring items. Visit your own kingdom's Messenger NPC to send and receive parcelled items (Clans often have their own messanger NPC too). Sending a parcel will cost 2x the normal deposit cost of an item. Parcels don't hang around forever! If the item isn't collected within 30 days, it will be destroyed.

To transfer money using this system, you buy and parcel Checks in fixed increments. Checks are also available and convertable back to gold at messenger NPCs. This is often used for write-in community events.
