# Money

NexusTK's economy can be daunting and difficult to break into. Thankfully, NTK's community is generous, so it need not necessarily hold you back.

For pocket money at the very beginning, you can sell Acorns to the kingdom butchers. Other players will also readily help you out if you explain what you're looking to buy.

Registered characters above level 50 can collect Daily Coins from the tent in Buya Gathering. As these are needed for mark trials, they are worth a lot - although you yourself will need a large pile for your own trials. Coins can be collected every 11.5 hours, and can be collected on multiple characters. Characters on an account set up with automatic reregistration will receive two daily coins. There's a strong argument for making sure your account has four level 50 characters available to collect daily coins, as collecting coins has high returns for time spent as compared to manual gathering.

Mythic Nexus and Ancient Training Grounds both drop plentiful ambers of several kinds. Ambers can be sold to players at a good price once you've amassed enough. As unregistered players are limited in the amount of gold they can carry, they can use banked ambers as a substitute.

Mythic Keys aren't too difficult to obtain from Mythic Key bosses as a warrior, mage, or rogue, and each should net a reasonable price - though some are in higher demand than others.

Gold acorns are valuable to clans, but you'll need to seek out Green Squirrels to collect them quickly. Your own clan may have a private patch, or there's a field south of Nagnang where they are abundant. Once you've collected 10 or 20, you can try to find a clan interested in buying them.

Gathering skills like woodcutting and mining can offer an income independent of your strength, but they take a huge time investment to reach a level that would come close to rivalling other methods. Killing sheep in the wilderness for their wool, however, is fairly accessible to anyone with a few levels under their belt, and may be a reasonable option depending on current prices.

Consider attending any of the advertised community events. Check the Community events board to see if there's anything upcoming. These assorted games can award tidy sums, or better, to the lucky or skilled winners.

Certain pieces of equipment in NexusTK are extremely expensive. You shouldn't let this bother you - these items are never required to progress at a reasonable rate. Only when you are highly familiar with the kingdoms would you want to consider making this kind of investment.

The Etched Weapons repeatable quest offered by Kinung's Taik'pae will offer you reasonably competitive bonded weapons. This quest involves a ten day wait, however, so it is best to plan ahead. There are also other accessible weapons available at most points, such as Titanium blades and Slog's clubs for warriors, enchanted bloods or nimble blades for rogues.

Mages and Poets are much less reliant on equipment, and if well-practiced can function perfectly well - if not necessarily optimally - in a group with no equipment beyond the bare minimum.

If you're on good terms with your clan, they may be willing to lend you some equipment that otherwise wouldn't be affordable to you - provided they trust you enough to make sure the equipment is returned before you take a break.

Selling Kruna store items to players using the gift system can get you plenty of coin for day to day expenses if you're not inclined to farm. However, your account must be at least three months old to gift Kruna, and this would be very expensive if you're trying to afford a high value item.

True wealth comes from patience - the most highly prized items are often temporary event rewards. If you make sure you complete every large game-wide event that comes past - ideally on multiple characters - the rewards are often worth a substantial amount further down the road.

((Haha, remember when we had events?))
