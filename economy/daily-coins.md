# Daily Coins

Daily coins are a crucial source of income for newer players. They can be collected from the tent in Buya Gathering and serve multiple purposes.

## Requirements

- Character must be registered
- Character must be level 50 or above
- Can be collected every 11.5 hours
- Can be collected on multiple characters per account

## Quantities

- Standard registered characters: 1 daily coin per collection
- Characters on accounts with automatic reregistration: 2 daily coins per collection

## Uses

Daily coins are highly valuable because they are required to varying degrees by two different mark trials (ee culture and sa minor quests). Demand for daily coins gives these reliable value despite the relatively low time investment in acquiring them relative to other sources of income.

Daily coins are also used to access [Damaged Orbs](combat/orbs.md), and the experience bonuses that are available during periods of celebration.

## Tips

- Consider raising multiple characters to level 50 as soon as is convenient to start amassing coins
- Sell just enough to fund your adventures, hoard them for your own trials.
- Consider making use of the auto registration bonus
